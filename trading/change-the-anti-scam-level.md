# Change the Anti-Scam level

When trading in Bugs+, you may get alerts for possible scams, like unbalanced trades, trades from very new users, users with a current scam investigation and other things like that. You can also change the Anti-Scam level. We have different levels since there may be false positives, but we recommend you to look at them. Anti-Scam levels cannot be turned off.

Here are the different anti-scam levels:

* Enhanced - This has better unbalanced trade detection, and it also looks for users that are new (like created less than 2 days ago) other than very new (like created less 1 day ago). It also looks for suspicious usernames and userids. Enhanced Anti-Scam is required to apply for a Trading License.
* Advanced - This is the default Anti-Scam experience. It has normal unbalanced trade detection. It also looks for very new users (less created than 1 day ago).

You can change the anti-scam level by following the following steps:

**On a version without the S Key alerting system:**

* Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
* Press Settings.
* Press Trading
* Press Anti-Scam
* Press Anti-Scam Level
* Choose the Anti-Scam level you want to use.

**On a version with support for the S Key alerting system:**

* Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
* Press Settings
* Press Trading
* Press Anti-Scam & Abuse Centre
* Press Configure Anti-Scam in the list of Features
* Select Anti-Scam Level
* Choose the Anti-Scam level you want to use.

**Note:** Unlike the Anti-Scam & Abuse Centre, Anti-Scam levels are per-device.
