### Reporting Lots Of Trades

If you need to report lots of trades from the same user, you can just use the normal form, or if it’s just the same thing or more than lots of trades, just use our support contact tool [http://bugsplus.me/support](http://bugsplus.me/support).

## Manual reporting

If you can’t use the interface to report the scam, you can also go to [http://link.bugsplus.me/sr](https://link.bugsplus.me/sr) to report the scam instead. You will still need to provide the details manually, but it’s better than nothing.

### Player Reports & Investigation for Suppressed Trades

If you don’t know the Trade ID, since the trade is no longer there or has been suppressed or removed, you can use the Player Reports and Investigations tool instead, which you can use at [http://bugsplus.me/support](http://bugsplus.me/support).

## Use A Anti-Scam And Abuse Feature

The most common anti-scam and abuse feature is the S Key. Press the S Key on your keyboard 4 times, wait for the countdown, and chat with support real-time.

## No Need To Rush!
