<summary>Anti-Scam Levels &#x26; Scam Alerts</summary>

Just at the moment the user is pressing the Accept button after a trade, and it looks scammy (some scam trades may not be detected regardless of the scam detection level), the user will be stopped from doing the trade and get a Suspicious Trade Alert. You can change the level as well, see /

<summary>Report scams and abuse in real time with our emergency alerting system</summary>

Pressing the S button 4 times will show a 8 second countdown, will play a siren noise, and will contact Bugs+ Support and we will come and solve the issue ASAP, while getting in contact with support in real time. To prevent false alarms, this does not apply while typing, but you can quickly exit out of the page and press it. You will also get a shortcut on scam alerts you get. This is quicker and higher priority than low-priority scam reports. If you accidentally press that key too much, you can cancel it.

We will also get a hint of what trade or page you are in, so make sure to stay on that screen!\
After the countdown, use the buttons and text boxes to interact with support and watch out for messages from our team. Make sure not to abuse this or else you could get banned.

In some cases, it may take less than 40 seconds for someone to login, while you wait you can also cancel it. If everyone in the team is sleeping or idle, the alert will be on hold, the popup will go away and show a short message, we will send you a follow up message to your linked BugID Email (contact support to update it) as soon as we see your message. If you don’t get a response, try alerting us again after a few hours or after 1 or 2 days.

You can also mention trade IDs, users and more by pressing Add Resources.

To end the call after someone accepted it, press End Emergency Alert, then confirm it.

If we accepted it after the countdown, and it is an accidental call, please tell us using the messaging function. Otherwise, we may reply to you back unnecessarily via Email.

If you add resources, the person who you are reporting won’t get notified, and if we take action, we won't include your name or other reporters for privacy and trust reasons, we will just say that we took action based on our review.

We show off this feature in What’s New popups, Scam Alerts and certain suggestions.

Prank calls and fake calls are not allowed and will result in a quick hang up, and a warning or ban appearing when you next open Bugs+. Accidental calls are allowed but don’t do it too much since we may think it is a prank, since only our team knows who did the alert. Also only one other Bugs+ Support person can connect to your call at a time.

**Here's what will happen when you trigger our Real Time Alerting System**

After the countdown, Bugs+ and your device will:

<i class="fa-check">:check:</i> Connect you to Bugs+ Support via our Real Time Alerting System

<i class="fa-check">:check:</i> The support agent may email you with a follow-up

<i class="fa-check">:check:</i> Enable Emergency Logging Mode - Bugs+ will collect info on what's happening on your screen so you can send it to us later or for future reference, you may get a call back during this time. Duration: 2 minutes, updates every time you go to a different resource. This happens after the call.
