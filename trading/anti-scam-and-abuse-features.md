# Anti-Scam and Abuse Features

Bugs+ comes with a handful of useful anti-scam features, and they are listed below:

<summary>Anti-Scam Levels &#x26; Scam Alerts</summary>

Just at the moment the user is pressing the Accept button after a trade, and it looks scammy (some scam trades may not be detected regardless of the scam detection level), the user will be stopped from doing the trade and get a Suspicious Trade Alert. You can change the level as well, see /

<summary>Report scams and abuse in real time with our emergency alerting system</summary>

Pressing the S button 4 times will show a 8 second countdown, will play a siren noise, and will contact Bugs+ Support and we will come and solve the issue ASAP, while getting in contact with support in real time. To prevent false alarms, this does not apply while typing, but you can quickly exit out of the page and press it. You will also get a shortcut on scam alerts you get. This is quicker and higher priority than low-priority scam reports. If you accidentally press that key too much, you can cancel it.
