From time to time, we will make offers where you can earn Trade Ad vouchers in exchange for a survey, just like how we do survey offers sometimes for Bug Points.&#x20;

You can find the offer, if available, at https://bugsplus.me/trade-ad-voucher-offer and following the instructions to do the survey and get access to the offer.

You can get one trade ad voucher per Trade Ad Voucher offer, some offers are only for new trade advertisers.

Keep progressing through Bugs+ to unlock [Gift Boxes](../../gameplay/gift-boxes.md), and participate in events a lot. Also, you can use the boosts from [Bugs+ Moth](../../gameplay/moth.md) to boost the chances of better rewards in events and get Gift Boxes faster.
