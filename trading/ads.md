# Trade Ads

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature requires a BugID.
{% endhint %}

As a Bugs+ Trader looking for people to exchange Trading Cards with and wants to expand their reach, With Trade Ads, you can now display a small ad in the Trade Directory of Bugs+ that is not annoying. This makes it so you can help others learn about Bugs and learn more about Bugs yourself.

As a normal Bugs+ user or trader, when looking at the trading directory, you can see small Trade Ads at the top and in the middle. They show on the first Load More / Next Page click, but they also show again at the top every 4 clicks of the next page button, and in the middle of some of those.

And they are very small so they can help you find traders that actually want a trader to trade with them, since the normal trade directory is random.

## Ad Approval

Note that trader’s Trade Ads accounts must be approved with Level 1 Approval (anyone that is the Approver level or higher) if no other approval levels are automatically applied. If the Trade Ad contains text, it will need Level 2 approval (only Admins can approve) regardless of if the account has been approved or not. Also, trader‘s Trade Ads that usually set off the Enhanced anti-scam system, or users with a low trading score, it will also require Level 3 Approval which means only Super Admins can approve It.

These are different to Anti-Scam levels, but Anti-Scam levels can also help decide the Trade Ads Approval Level other than only using it for Anti-Scam detection in trades.

## Change Trade Ads frequency

It is possible to change the frequency of Trade Ads or remove Trade Ads altogether. The Trade Ads frequency configuration only applies to one device so logging out will clear the configuration. Here is how to do this:

1. Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
2. Press Settings
3. Press Trading
4. Press Trade Ads Settings
5. Select a new frequency. Frequency options are shown as below:

* Default Trade Ads Experience - The default Trade Ads experience every trader starts with. With this configuration, small Trade Ads show on the first Load More / Next Page click, but they also show again at the top every 4 clicks of the next page button, and in the middle of some of those. This aims for a smooth experience, while seeing trade ads which help you on finding a user to send a trade request to that actually wants it while getting the organic random suggestions.
* Extra Trade Ads Experience - Find the Trade Ads helpful? With this Opt-In Experience you will be able to see more Trade Ads while looking at the Trade Directory. If you choose to opt in, Trade Ads will show more often, showing ads at the top every time you load more, and the middle ads are still there.
* Less Trade Ads Experience - Don’t want as many trade ads, but still find them a bit useful? With this Opt-in Experience, less trade ads will show. Your trade ads frequency will be changed to every 6 Load More clicks and showing on the first page as well, with less Middle page Ads.
* Disable Trade Ads - This option will remove Trade Ads from the Trade Directory. However, users with a current Trade Ads campaign running will still show if they are chosen in the random order, but their displayed Trade Ad won’t show in the Trade Directory on your screen.
