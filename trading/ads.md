# Trade Ads

As a Bugs+ Trader looking for people to exchange Trading Cards with and wants to expand their reach, With Trade Ads, you can now display a small ad in the Trade Directory of Bugs+ that is not annoying. This makes it so you can help others learn about Bugs and learn more about Bugs yourself.

As a normal Bugs+ user or trader, when looking at the trading directory, you can see small Trade Ads at the top and in the middle. They show on the first Load More / Next Page click, but they also show again at the top every 4 clicks of the next page button, and in the middle of some of those,&#x20;

and they are very small so they can help you find traders that actually want a trader to trade with them, since the normal trade directory is random.

More information is coming soon.
