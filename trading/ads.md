# Trade Ads

As a Bugs+ Trader looking for people to exchange Trading Cards with and wants to expand their reach, With Trade Ads, you can now display a small ad in the Trade Directory of Bugs+ that is not annoying. This makes it so you can help others learn about Bugs and learn more about Bugs yourself.

As a normal Bugs+ user or trader, when looking at the trading directory, you can see small Trade Ads at the top and in the middle. They show on the first Load More / Next Page click, but they also show again at the top every 4 clicks of the next page button, and in the middle of some of those.

And they are very small so they can help you find traders that actually want a trader to trade with them, since the normal trade directory is random.

## Ad Approval

Note that trader’s Trade Ads accounts must be approved with Level 1 Approval (anyone that is the Approver level or higher) if no other approval levels are automatically applied. If the Trade Ad contains text, it will need Level 2 approval (only Admins can approve) regardless of if the account has been approved or not. Also, trader‘s Trade Ads that usually set off the Enhanced anti-scam system, or users with a low trading score, it will also require Level 3 Approval which means only Super Admins can approve It.

These are different to Anti-Scam levels, but Anti-Scam levels can also help decide the Trade Ads Approval Level other than only using it for Anti-Scam detection in trades.
