# Unlock Advanced Trading Features with a Trading License

{% hint style="info" %}
### We are on to it!

This feature is Coming Soon. Stay tuned! But in the meantime, you can learn more about what is feature is. We will be rolling this feature out to you soon - make stay to stay tuned!
{% endhint %}

Bugs+ also offers more features for Trading, not just the default set of features, so you can make the most of learning about insects, and help others.

But unfortunately, there are scammers that abuse Trading in Bugs+. To help prevent this, we also have more anti-scam measures that include restricting access to some trading features.

You don’t need these advanced features to trade in Bugs+, since trading is a BugID feature, but you can still unlock these advanced features anyway.

These features are not only for letting us and other people know that you are a verified trader, this also indicates that you know how to find scams and reject and report scammers, and actually do it when needed.

The purpose of this is to make sure people don’t scam people but still get info on insects from the received trading cards and help others with lots of features.

## Trading Licence Features

Some of the additional features include getting a verified trader badge that shows on your profile and in trades, the other person’s anti-scam is less likely to go off on your trades (but you will still see anti-scam alerts for other people you trade with), you can also trade high-end items like Ultra Legendary, and Limited items (and get access to trading Legendary items if not already unlocked), trade more items in trades, and more.
