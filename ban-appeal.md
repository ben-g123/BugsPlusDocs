# Submit a ban appeal

To submit a ban appeal in Bugs+, you can use Account Status & Appeals. It appears on the ban, trade ban, warning or punishment page you have received. You can also contact [Bugs+ Support](http://bugsplus.me/support) to appeal the ban, but please try using Account Status & Appeals First.

Here are some steps to appeal a ban via the ban screen:

1. Open the ban page and press the Account Status & Appeals button. If you can still use Bugs+ but with restrictions and there is no ban screen, press the person button on the side (account tab) then press Account Status & Appeals
2. Press the New Appeal Button.
3. Choose what punishment you received on the list that shows.
4. Type the appeal information. It will ask you for the appeal reason(s) and why you want to be unbanned. If you chose Other, you will need to provide the Punishment reason.

We will review your request soon. You can see updates by using the appeal code and tracking it on Account Status & Appeals. If you donâ€˜t get an update or you want to re-appeal, submit another appeal via Account Status & Appeals or use Support instead.

Make sure to provide as much information as possible.

## Appeal a ban or punishment on behalf of your child

If you setup a Kids Account for your child, you can appeal on behalf of your child. You only need to click on the "Appeal This Punishment On Behalf Of My Child" button in the email that they got a punishment and fill out the form for them.
