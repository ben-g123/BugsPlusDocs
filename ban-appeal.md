# Submit a ban appeal

To submit a ban appeal in Bugs+, you can use Account Status & Appeals. It appears on the ban, trade ban, warning or punishment page you have received. You can also contact [Bugs+ Support](http://bugsplus.me/support) to appeal the ban, but please try using Account Status & Appeals First.

Here are some steps to appeal a ban via the ban screen:

1. Open the ban page and press the Account Status & Appeals button. If you can still use Bugs+ but with restrictions and there is no ban screen, press the person button on the side (account tab) then press Account Status & Appeals
2. Press the New Appeal Button.
3. Choose what punishment you received on the list that shows.
4. Type the appeal information. It will ask you for the appeal reason(s) and why you want to be unbanned. If you chose Other, you will need to provide the Punishment reason.

We will review your request soon. You can see updates by using the appeal code and tracking it on Account Status & Appeals. If you don‘t get an update or you want to re-appeal, submit another appeal via Account Status & Appeals or use Support instead.

Make sure to provide as much information as possible.

From the time of getting a punishment, you have have 9 months to appeal our decisions. If you don’t appeal, your punishment will still be on our records. If it was a permanent ban or punishment, then you can no longer appeal.

### What if I am permanently banned or punished in or from Bugs+? How can I appeal if it has been 9 months?

If it is before the 9 months, use the usual appeal steps. If it has been 9 months, then you can no longer submit appeals that will be considered. However, some appeal reasons is eligible to “revive” your account by getting it unbanned, simply by using the Reports System at [https://bugsplusreports.byethost7.com/reports-system/open.php](https://bugsplusreports.byethost7.com/reports-system/open.php) then go to the drop down and select Account Revival Requests. Make sure to note down the ticket number or use an account so you can easily access the final decision. If you don’t get a response, ping Bugs+ Support at http://bugsplus.me/support and also if you can, note down the ticket number.
