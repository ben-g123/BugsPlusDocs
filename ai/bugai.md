## Improving BugAI

You can opt in to help improve BugAI by sharing your BugAI history. This is called a AI Report. BugAI will ask you when you first use BugAI on a new device, you can say if you want it or not. This preference is per device. You can change it at any time by going to the Account tab (the person icon) then press Settings then press AI Features then press AI Report and change if you want to automatically share your AI history so we can help improve AI Features or download today's AI history.
