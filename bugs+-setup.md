# Bugs+ Setup

You can setup and download Bugs+ very easily. Firstly, make sure you downloaded it first at [http://bugsplus.me/page?p=download](http://bugsplus.me/page?p=download)

Then, after you downloaded it, move it to the Applications folder (or similar, ignore if there is none on your computer). Then, open it and either sign in with your BugID or use Guest Mode. Using BugID is recommended.

It will be setup after that, but you can still change settings later.

You can use Bugs+ on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Bugs+ is not availble on mobile, but you can still create a BugID and reset itâ€™s password. You can access the Demo on Mobile & Computer.
