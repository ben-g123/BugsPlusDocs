# Bugs+ Setup

You can setup and download Bugs+ very easily. Firstly, make sure you downloaded it first at [http://bugsplus.me/page?p=download](http://bugsplus.me/page?p=download)

Then, after you downloaded it, move it to the Applications folder (or similar, ignore if there is none on your computer). Then, open it and either sign in with your BugID or use Guest Mode. Using BugID is recommended.

It will be setup after that, but you can still change settings later.

You can use Bugs+ on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Bugs+ is not available on mobile, but you can still create a BugID and reset itâ€™s password.

In the future, we may make a limited version of Bugs+ as a mobile app, where you can see your friends list, check notifications, do Mini Quizzes (small and limited quizzes that changes every day), and you will be able to pair it with a Computer app (you will not be able to setup Bugs+ on mobile, only paring).
