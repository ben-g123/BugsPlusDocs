## Child Account Birthday Changes

You can’t change your birthdate to before 12 years old if the account is not already set to 12 or younger. If this happens, please contact support ASAP at http://bugsplus.me/support so we can help you change your birthdate to the correct one. Failure to do so will result in bans and false information is against the law.

If a child with a Kids Account try’s to change their birthdate, they will be required to either ask their parent (the parent will use the Parent PIN to confirm, the birthdate will update straight away after using the PIN) or to provide evidence (it may take up to 7 days to confirm and update the account’s age). Also, if the account is not a kids account but is under 16 and is trying to change their age they will need to provide evidence.

Changing the account age to over 18 will permanently  turn off parental controls (since reaching that age will also do that) which can’t be undone without the help of Bugs+ support (http://bugsplus.me).
