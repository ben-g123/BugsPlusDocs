# BugID Account Credit

Some credits received from some events and some Gift Codes may turn into BugID Account Credit. You can then later turn it into Bug Points, Stars, Bugs+ Moth subscriptions, Gift Boxes or other gifts.

## Why did I get BugID Account Credit?

You would of also got a notification with a reason and information on redeeming, but here are some reasons you would of got BugID Account Credit:

<i class="fa-calendar-star">:calendar-star:</i> Certain Special Events

<i class="fa-gift">:gift:</i> Some Gift Codes

<i class="fa-message-question">:message-question:</i> As a compensation from Support for certain issues

<i class="fa-folder-xmark">:folder-xmark:</i> As a compensation for removed items or trading cards that you have originally got

<i class="fa-gifts">:gifts:</i> When you redeem Gift Codes that are user generated (not by the Admins)

<i class="fa-heart">:heart:</i> As a Thank You gift from the Bugs+ Admins

<i class="fa-ticket">:ticket:</i> As a gift from getting or sending a Friend Pass

<i class="fa-bug">:bug:</i> It may also be a glitch in Bugs+, if you suspect it is, please Contact Support instead of redeeming the glitched credit

## What You Can Do With Your Credits

Here are some ideas on what to do when you get some:

<i class="fa-money-bills">:money-bills:</i> Spend it and get a reward

<i class="fa-gift">:gift:</i> Create a gift code for it and gift it to someone

<i class="fa-shield">:shield:</i> Keep it and save up for something big

<i class="fa-flag-swallowtail">:flag-swallowtail:</i> Report the BugID Account Credits at Bugs+ Support if it looks glitched or you did not get enough credits and the credit amounts are unfair

## Pending Credits

For some (not all) Account Credits you get, like most compensations from support, you will need to accept the Bugs+ Rules and the Bugs+ Account Credits Agreement to get Account Credits. After accepting via the Bugs+ App (or Bugs+ Support), you will need to wait a day then after the day, the credits will be added as soon as you login. If more pending credits gets added after that day but you did not login yet, they will also be added without needing to wait. You have to do this every time you get pending credits.

### Accepting Your Pending Credits

1. Open Bugs+ and go to the Home tab (the house icon) and you should see a notice saying "Pending Account Credits, please use the button below to claim it".
2. &#x20;Then, press the Claim Account Credits, and read the agreements and rules.
3. Then, press the Accept button.
4. Your pending credits will come the next day.

Rejecting the pending credit agreements will remove the pending credits without getting them, and will ban your account until you request a account review. If you don't want to do it at that time, you can Dismiss the agreements and do it later.

## Prices for each reward

BugID account credits are measured in dollars, but Bugs+ is still free, and it will always be, and you can't buy account credits with real money and you also can't exchange them for real money.

But here are the prices for every reward:
