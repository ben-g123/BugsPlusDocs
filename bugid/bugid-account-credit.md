## Prices for each reward

BugID account credits are measured in dollars, but Bugs+ is still free, and it will always be, and you can't buy account credits with real money and you also can't exchange them for real money.

But here are the prices for every reward:

* Every 5 Bug Points costs $0.25 Account Credits, which means Every 1 bug point is $0.05 Account Credits
* Every 100 Bug Points costs $5 Account Credits
* Every 1000 Bug Points costs $45 Account Credits, since if you get 1000 Bug Points, you get $5 Account Credits off
* More info on reward prizes are coming soon
