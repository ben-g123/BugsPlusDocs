# How do I merge my Guest Mode data to a BugID?

You can merge your Guest Mode data without losing it by following the following steps:

* Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
* Press Merge Data To BugID. You will only see this if you are in Guest Mode.
* Follow the instructions on the screen. If you set a PIN, you will need to enter that as well.

{% hint style="info" %}
This only works on BugID accounts that have not already been used to successfully first sign into Bugs+ before.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you have set a PIN, you can’t merge account data to a BugID when you forgot the PIN and can’t sign in (and you need to find the PIN so far) and merge the account data.
{% endhint %}
