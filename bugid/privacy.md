# Privacy Notice

We do not track you on the Bugs+ App, but we may use analytics on the Bugs+ Website (bugsplus.me) and the Bugs+ Docs (docs.bugsplus.me) which you can opt out to.

We aim to keep your data secure, and you can request an export via Bugs+ support (bugsplus.me/support). You can also delete your data by contacting Bugs+ support (if it is your first day using Bugs+, you can delete it by clicking on the Account tab (the person icon) then press Delete Account.)

We will only access or/and edit some non-personal-identifying information for the purpose of helping you in support cases and fighting abuse and spam only.

If you setup an account for a user under 12 years old, a email will be sent to the parentâ€™s email with a link to verify that a parent is involved and is creating a account for their child rather than the child creating it for themselves. (they will also need to provide additional proof), and manage what features are available. This is a secure service that is provided by Kids Web Services,  integrated into Bugs+. This will also be covered by their privacy policy for verification.
