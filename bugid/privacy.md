# Privacy Notice

We do not track you on the Bugs+ App, but we may use analytics on the Bugs+ Website (bugsplus.me) and the Bugs+ Docs (docs.bugsplus.me) which you can opt out to.

We aim to keep your data secure, and you can request an export via Bugs+ support (bugsplus.me/support). You can also delete your data by contacting Bugs+ support (if it is your first day using Bugs+, you can delete it by clicking on the Account tab (the person icon) then press Delete Account). The account will be permanently deleted after 14 days, unless on your first day. During that time, your account will be globally locked (different to a ban, but you can't login and see the reason). You can cancel the deletion by contacting Bugs+ Support (bugsplus.me/support). You can also ban your own account by going to the Account tab then press Close Account, then press Ban My Account instead of the button contact support for deletion. While this does not delete your account and data, it restricts trades, and shows less profile data and shows a notice, and you can login at any time. Note that a password and username is only required to unban the account (you can only unban your account that you banned yourself, not the moderation bans), and a PIN won’t be required to do this. It is possible to logout after a self ban, and when not banned, but not for moderation bans.

We will only access or/and edit some non-personal-identifying information for the purpose of helping you in support cases and fighting abuse and spam only.

If you setup an account for a user under 12 years old, a email will be sent to the parent’s email with a link to verify that a parent is involved and is creating a account for their child rather than the child creating it for themselves. (they will also need to provide additional proof), and manage what features are available. This is a secure service that is provided by Kids Web Services,  integrated into Bugs+. This will also be covered by their privacy policy for verification.

You can switch to a private (friends only can see your profile and trade with you) or a public profile (anyone can see your profile, choose who can trade with you) by following the following steps:

* Open the Account tab (the person icon)
* Press Account Settings
* Press Account Privacy
* Press Private Profile
* Choose a Private or Public profile

Parents can also force a Private Profile on their kid account under 12 years old by revoking the Public Profile right. You can do this by editing the rights configuration at http://bugsplus.me/parent-portal and removing the Public Profile right (COMING SOON). After you do this, your child will get a Private Profile as soon as they login again. If you give the right back, they will need to change their profile to a Public profile again if you want their profile to be Public.
