# Bugs+ Rules

At Bugs+ we made some rules that people need to follow or else moderation actions will be taken against them. We want to share these rules with you to protect your account from random bans and punishments.

## Rule 1: No Swearing

In Lobbies, usernames, Wikis and other services by Bugs+, swearing is not allowed. We have automated detection systems that actively take action against people who swear.

## Rule 2: No Scamming

Scamming and misleading trades are not allowed on Bugs+. It will get you banned if you attempt to do it. There are also Anti-Scam systems that warn you and other people of possible scams.

## Rule 3: No Spamming & Promotion

Bugs+ is a educational game, not a place to spam and promote businesses. There are other platforms to do that such as Google Ads and listing sites.

## Rule 4: Security Policy

Please don’t hack anyone on Bugs+, and don’t share passwords. (on purpose, accidents are fine)

## Rule 5: Follow any general rules and laws

There are some rules and laws that we didn’t cover, but breaking those is still a violation of the rules.

[BugSearch](https://bugsplus.me/bugsearch) has different rules like the website indexing rules (and also follows Google’s terms of service since we have a partnership \[kinda but not really])

We may update these rules and will notify you via Bugs+ of any changes. Failure to read the new rules and approve them will result in your account getting banned from Bugs+. (and all your data getting out of reach until we do a full review of your account)
