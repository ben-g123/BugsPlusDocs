# Bugs+ Rules

At Bugs+ we made some rules that people need to follow or else moderation actions will be taken against them. We want to share these rules with you to protect your account from random bans and punishments.

You can find out what rule you broke by seeing the ban notice, warning notice, or notification. If you don't get a popup, check the Notification Bell. If you still need help, contact Bugs+ Support (bugsplus.me/support). You can appeal with a link in the alert or ban screen.

Our rules are regularly updated, and we have transparency on when we last update our rules. Transparency statusboard:

## Rule 1: No Swearing

In Lobbies, usernames, Wikis and other services by Bugs+, swearing is not allowed. We have automated detection systems that actively take action against people who swear.

## Rule 2: No Scamming

Scamming and misleading trades are not allowed on Bugs+. It will get you banned if you attempt to do it. There are also Anti-Scam systems that warn you and other people of possible scams.

## Rule 3: No Spamming & Promotion

Bugs+ is a educational game, not a place to spam and promote businesses. There are other platforms to do that such as Google Ads and listing sites.

## Rule 4: Security Policy

Please don’t hack anyone on Bugs+, and don’t share passwords. (on purpose, accidents are fine)

## Rule 5: Follow any general rules and laws

There are some rules and laws that we didn’t cover, but breaking those is still a violation of the rules.

[BugSearch](https://bugsplus.me/bugsearch) has different rules like the website indexing rules (and also follows Google’s terms of service since we have a partnership \[kinda but not really])

We may update these rules and will notify you via Bugs+ of any changes. Failure to read the new rules and approve them will result in your account getting banned from Bugs+. (and all your data getting out of reach until we do a full review of your account)

## Rule 6: Don’t cheat

This is an educational game, please don’t cheat! This takes the learning away, and makes it unfair for everyone, so don‘t do it. If you accidentally find a glitch, it’s fine (unless you did it on purpose), but please try to undo the cheat or contact support and report the glitch. This includes trying to get infinite or unlimited Bug Points or Stars. This includes game modding.

## Rule 7: Choose The Right Age

Make sure to choose the right age of the main account user when you signup, instead of your age (unless you are the main account user). Failure to do so will result in Bans. You will get 3 opportunities when you choose the age to choose the right one. You can't change this without support if you choose Over 12.
