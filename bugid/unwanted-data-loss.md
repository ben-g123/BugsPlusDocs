# I did not go on Bugs+ for a long time (6+ months) and my data is gone!

If you are inactive for more than 6+ months, you are not banned or have no investigation in progress in the last 8 months, you are not on a high level and we think you are very unlikely to come back, then your some or all of your data may get removed, and if not, some other reason.

## **Possible Reasons**

Here are some possible reasons for data loss:

### Data Removal

If you are inactive for more than 6+ months, you are not banned or have no investigation in progress in the last 8 months, you are not on a high level and we think you are very unlikely to come back, then your some or all of your data may get removed. A way to prevent this in the future, is to login regularly, and do something that gives you more or less progress in Bugs+.

You also would of got an email about this.

#### How can I appeal this?

You can appeal this by contacting Bugs+ Support at https://bugsplus.me/support and including info on that you will be using Bugs+. Appealing this will most likely succeed, and make it unlikely for data to be removed in the future. You only have limited time to appeal it. If you missed the time, another email will be sent and everything will be gone expect your login for a few extra years and your account will get banned, and you can appeal it but you will have to start again and a reset will be required in the recovery agreement.

### Hacking

If some but not all data has vanished, but not all of it , then the hacker may of traded trading cards with the hacker, refunded trading cards and spent the reward as revenge and more. Even worse, they may of erased data or deleted your account.

### Ban timeout

If you got permanently banned, missed the appeal window, and missed the final revivals window, we will go on and delete all your data for privacy reasons (we may keep some suspicious data for some time for extra investigation), and ban you until you contact us. Appealing this too late will require a reset which will be added to the recovery agreement.
