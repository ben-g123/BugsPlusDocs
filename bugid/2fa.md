# 2FA

2FA is required to use a BugID. This ensures that people won’t get hacked, since it is very rare for 2FA to get hacked without the person’s devices or email accounts. You can set it up when you create a BugID. The methods available are Security Key, 2FA Authenticator app or using the Auth0 Guardian app. You will be able to setup Passkeys after this if you want, and you will also get a backup code to save just in case since if you loose it, only Bugs+ Support will be able to help you with 2FA if you do loose the backup code.

If you don’t have a 2FA App, search up authenticator 2FA app on Google, you can get one for free on your phone or/and computer, or download Auth0 Guardian (phone only), or use security keys.

## Reset 2FA Status

If you need to setup 2FA Again, you can press the Account tab (the person icon) then Account Settings then Security & Login then press Reset 2FA. Then confirm it. You can then setup 2FA Again. If the page does not load, next time you login to Bugs+ you can set it up again.

You can also get Bugs+ Support to help you. The link for that is http://bugsplus.me/support.
