# Can I delete data if I’m locked out of my account?

Yes and no. You can ask Bugs+ Support to delete your account, but please provide evidence. If you just want to do Erase Data, you can’t. This is to prevent bad people from deleting other people’s accounts.

Please note that if you delete your account, there will be 14 days to recover it before it is gone forever, unlike data removal via the UI.
