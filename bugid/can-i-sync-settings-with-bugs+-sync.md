# Can I sync settings with Bugs+ Sync?

Bugs+ does not currently sync settings, but Account Settings are still synced since they are linked to a BugID. This includes the PIN you have set. This means settings are tied to each device. Also, settings are cleared when you logout of your BugID.

We may decide to sync Settings in the future. If you really want this feature, you can Contact Support at http://bugsplus.me/support and tell Bugs+ Support that you want this feature.

A workaround to this is to take screenshots of your settings values, this is useful if you donâ€™t change them often, but you will need to manually change them for each new device or setting change.
