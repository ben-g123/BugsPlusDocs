# Friends List

In Bugs+, you can invite your friends in Bugs+. This lets you share what you have been learning in Bugs+ easily, Easily send a Friend Request and more.

You can manage and see your friends by going to the Community tab (the cell phone tower icon) and pressing Friend List.

## Add A Friend

You can add a friend by going to the Friends List and pressing Add Friend. Enter their username in the box and send the friend request.

If a friend sent you a friend request, you can go to the Friends List, press Select Friend and type their username to approve or reject it. Note that if parental controls restrict friending, when the child or teenager tries to accept or reject the friend request, just before the options show, it will automatically reject the friend request and send a notice about that parental controls restrict friending, and show a notice to the child or teenager.

If the friend set their Account Settings to require a friend code or other form of proof to send a friend request, you will need to ask them for their friend code or provide proof (like entering your friendâ€˜s email address).
