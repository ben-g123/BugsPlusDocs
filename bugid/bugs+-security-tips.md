# Bugs+ Security Tips

Here are some helpful tips on how to keep your account and Bugs+ application secure.

* **Choose a good password.** Even though 2FA is enabled, the hackers could know how to hack your 2FA Methods (which is unlikely). There is password requirements, but still choose a good password!
* **Listen to security alerts.** If a hacker has used all of the maximum unsuccessful attempts in a row (which is 7, it resets when you login again) the account will be login-banned and you will get a email. Make sure to secure your account when you get that email when you did not use th, maybe even contact support and donâ€™t use the un-login-ban link until your account is secure. The support people can check your login history for you and help you. If you want to learn more, see our guide on [security-alerts.md](security-alerts.md "mention").
* **Use a good 2FA Method.** Make sure to choose a good 2FA method, and avoid using Passkeys on public devices, and reset 2FA and set it up again when compromised.
* **Avoid using Trust This Device and use sign-out wisely.** Trust This Device is useful if you need to access the login page a lot, but for most people, you are already logged into Bugs+. Bugs+ does not auto log out, but sometimes it may logout. Trusting a device has nothing to do with if you will get signed out or not in the Bugs+ desktop app.
* **Watch out for scams and phishing pages, either inside Bugs+ or outside Bugs+.** These are unsafe.
