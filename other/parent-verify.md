# Parent Verify

If the child using a BugID is under 12, they will need a parent to verify that they are allowed to use Bugs+, using ID or Face Scan. This service is powered by Kids Web Services.

To add and revoke rights for your child (permissions, like trading with real players and more), go to http://bugsplus.me/parent-portal (COMING SOON) and follow the steps there.
