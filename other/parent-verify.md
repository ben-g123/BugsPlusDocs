# Parent Verify

If the child using a BugID is under 12, they will need a parent to verify that they are allowed to use Bugs+, using ID or Face Scan. This service is powered by Kids Web Services. The parent will get an email with the link to start verification. Parents can also use this for users under 18 but over 12 (but it is optional if they are using it on a teenager.)

Parents will also get notifications if the child did wrong things on Bugs+, with the chance to appeal on behalf of them.

This can be delayed by one day by pressing Maybe Later. After that it will be forced.

To add and revoke rights for your child (permissions, like trading with real players and more), go to https://bugsplus.me/parent-portal (COMING SOON) and follow the steps there.

If you already verified using that email on another platform, or used it for another Bugs+ Kids Account with Kids Web Services technology, you can skip needing to verify and just need to click on one link in your email.

After verifying, the parent can set a Parent PIN. This cannot be changed after setting it without the help of Bugs+ support (https://bugsplus.me/support). This parent PIN is only needed to perform actions on the device relating to parental controls and wonâ€™t affect the parent portal access (which uses email links instead). An example of this is changing the birthdate for the BugID.

### Please provide the right age

Please make sure to enter the correct age for your child. Failure to do so will get your child's acount banned and it is illegal to provide the wrong age. Please contact support at https://bugsplus.me/support if you accidentally provided the wrong age, or need help doing the verification methods.&#x20;
