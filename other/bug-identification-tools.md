# Bug Identification Tools

Have a photo of a bug on your computer? You can go to the More tab then press Identify Insect and upload the photo and our system will identify it. You can also save the insect identification results for later by creating an access code. The access code will last for 6 months. You can also save a file to your computer to get access to the identification result later even without the access code.
