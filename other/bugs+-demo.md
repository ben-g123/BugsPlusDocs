# Bugs+ Demo

Even though Bugs+ is free, we still provide a demo of Bugs+ with limited features. It is available for use in your browser, so you can test Bugs+ before you download it. Using the demo before you download it is not required, but it may be a good idea to.

You can see our demo at http://bugsplus.me/demo.

Here is what is included in our demo edition:

* 25 demo trading cards to collect, including the Human Botfly and Daddy Longlegs Spider.
* The first set of the Bugs+ Bug Catching Game levels.
* Comes with 2 quizzes to test your bug knowledge with and level up in the demo.
* Essential features of Bugs+ which are Points, Stars (stars are capped to 25 in the demo) and Levels and XP. The max level in the demo version is 50. The Daily Quests Refresher Item is not included in the demo, but if gained in the demo, it will be given on data transfer to the actual version.
* Includes 2 different trading demo types with AI Bots to get you ready to trade in Bugs+.
* You can transfer your data to the actual version at any time. Just go to the Account tab (the person icon) and press “Transfer save data to the actual version of Bugs+) then enter the transfer code on the actual Bugs+. make sure to press the button that says that you have played the demo and want to transfer your data, then enter the code.
* Some core shop items are available, while others are not.

On the other hand, some feature are not found in the demo such as these: (note that these will work in the actual version)

* BugID linking. However you can link a new BugID when you transfer your data to the actual version.
* Features related to BugID such as Trading with real players, friends lists and Bugs+ sync. These work on the actual version of Bugs+
* Most features that you find in Bugs+ are probably capped, restricted, only shows a tutorial or not available, or not even visible in the demo version. Do not rely on the demo to be able to play Bugs+ on mobile, since the demo will cap of completely or there is not much to learn after a while.

If you need support with the demo, limited support is available. We don’t use the normal support model with the demo, since there is no option to link a BugID, but there is some support still. You also need to say that you are using the demo for support.
