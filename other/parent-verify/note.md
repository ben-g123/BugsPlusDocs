{% hint style="info" %}
## Teach your kids & teenagers with this page

This page is for you and your child to read together so you both understand how the parental controls will work.
{% endhint %}

With parental controls, your parent can manage your Bugs+ application and keep you safe.

## What parents can manage and see

<i class="fa-sliders-up">:sliders-up:</i> Configure some parental settings such as trading configurations and more

<i class="fa-mobile">:mobile:</i> Scroll through your Bugs+ History to help protect you and make decisions

<i class="fa-lock">:lock:</i> Change your password when you need it (for Under 12 users only)

<i class="fa-hourglass-clock">:hourglass-clock:</i> Enforce learning features only time until stopped or until the end of the day, when the parent configures it to

<i class="fa-user-xmark">:user-xmark:</i> Remotely delete your account without support involvement (for Under 12 users only) and remotely ban your account until the end of the day or until ban stopped (all ages under 18 years old)

<i class="fa-user-gear">:user-gear:</i> Configure most settings for your BugID

<i class="fa-filter">:filter:</i> Gain access to miscellaneous features and controls where available

## What parents can’t do

* Delete your account after you turn 12
* Stop you from turning off parental controls even with the punishment after turning 12
* Remotely see your screen
* Reset your personal login PIN for Bugs+ without other recovery methods
* Reject trades or remove friends without the device or without disabling those features altogether
* Help you reset your password with only the Parent PIN after you turn 12
* Allow parental controls after turning 18
* Managing things remotely that is not in the supervision dashboard

## If you ever need to manage parental controls

You can ask your parent to manage parental controls and they can manage it for you.

Disabling parental controls withou consent will need you to wait for a minute timer after clicking on the button, a siren playing, and you getting banned for 1-day.\
You won’t be able to manage parental settings or disable parental settings without automatic punishments without knowing the Parent PIN. Using the PIN maximum attempts (11 attempts) on a device (except the supervision dashboard) will issue a lock-out for 4-days. Here’s what’s included in the lockout and how to recover from it if you are a parent:

* You will be able to recover parental access on that device by logging on to another device, and setting up remote supervision, then going to the dashboard, and go to Account Settings, and then select Parent PIN, then press Parental PIN Lockout Recovery, and enter the code you get onto the recovery screen. If you don’t get the option to do this, you will need to wait for the lockout to expire or logout and log in again.
* The lockout will be issued for 4-days. Parents will not be notified vis the dashboard.
* Note that only newer Bugs+ versions will have this functionality, so make sure to update both Bugs+ applications recovering from the lockout.
