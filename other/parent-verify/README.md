# Parent Verify

If the child using a BugID is under 12, they will need a parent to verify that they are allowed to use Bugs+, using ID or Face Scan. This service is powered by Kids Web Services. The parent will get an email with the link to start verification. Parents can also use this for users under 18 but over 12 (but it is optional if they are using it on a teenager.)

After verifying, you will be able to **setup parental controls** using your own device, then the parental controls will be applied to your child's device remotely (remote supervision) or manage simple controls on your child‘s device.

Parents will also get notifications if the child did wrong things on Bugs+, with the chance to appeal on behalf of them.

This can be delayed by one day by pressing Maybe Later. After that it will be forced.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## **Compatibility**

**All versions support parental controls, but here are recommended versions**\
Here is the minimum Bugs+ version to get modern and  proper parental controls:

* **Bugs+ 1.2** - Using a earlier version will only have limited parental controls, see [#devices-and-services-that-cant-be-supervised-or-have-limited-supervision](./#devices-and-services-that-cant-be-supervised-or-have-limited-supervision "mention")

Here is the recommended Bugs+ version if you want the latest features

* **The latest Bugs+ versions** - Talk to your child about why you should update Bugs+, including safety features, security fixed, glitch fixes, new features and more. You can also go on their computer and update it for them.
{% endhint %}

To add and revoke rights for your child (permissions, like trading with real players and more), download Bugs+ on your device, choose Continue With BugID and instead of logging in with BugID, choose Supervise a Kids Account remotely using this device and follow the steps there, including entering your child’s email or username, and entering the Parent PIN.

If you already verified using that email on another platform, or used it for another Bugs+ Kids Account with Kids Web Services technology, you can skip needing to verify and just need to click on one link in your email.

After verifying, the parent can set a Parent PIN. This cannot be changed after setting it without the help of Bugs+ support (https://bugsplus.me/support). This parent PIN is only needed to perform actions on the device relating to parental controls and won’t affect the parent portal access (which uses email links instead). An example of this is changing the birthdate for the BugID.

Here is a useful page to read with your child: [note.md](note.md "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
### Need Help?

If you received a Parent Verification email and you are sure it is not from your children, please file us an alert at https://bugsplus.me/support and we will investigate.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Please provide the right age

Please make sure to enter the correct age for your child. Failure to do so will get your child's acount banned and it is illegal to provide the wrong age. Please contact support at https://bugsplus.me/support if you accidentally provided the wrong age, or need help doing the verification methods.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unlink Parental Controls Without A PIN</summary>

To unlink parental controls without using a Parent PIN (useful if you forgot the PIN), please note that before the parental controls will be unlinked a siren noise will play on your device at the volume of what you set on your device (so make sure to turn off the volume), and note that the user will get banned until the next day starts as a punishment. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
2. Press Account Settings

1) Press Parental Controls
2) Press Unlink Parental Controls
3) Press "Unlink parental controls without parent"
4) Read the note carefully and press "Acknowledge & Unlink Parental Controls"
5) Wait for the 1 minute timer to finish, please don't close the page or window while the timer is on
6) The siren noise will go off, the user will get banned for a day and the parental controls will turn off.

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/parental-controls-unlinking-timer-method.md" %}

If you want to use another BugID or guest mode during the ban time, perform a Quick Restart by pressing the green flag at the top of the screen, while holding down the D key. Continue holding it even while selecting the buttons on the popup. If you see a popup, press the appropriate buttons on it. Then, you should see a Debug Mode instead of the title screen. Stop holding the key, and if you missed, restart those steps. Then, press the Reset button. Press the confirm button that will appear, then Bugs+ should restart. Now you can login to another account, note that you can login to your Kids Account that with the parental controls you have removed after the next day anytime without loosing any save data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unlink Parental Controls If The Person Is Over 18</summary>

You can also change your birthdate to over 18 to remove parental controls, this also requires the Parent PIN. Learn more at [change-bugid-account-birthdate.md](../../bugid/change-bugid-account-birthdate.md "mention").

After reaching that age (if you did not use the birthdate changing step it needs to be done manually), we won’t alert you, but you can follow these steps to unlink parental controls:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
2. Press Account Settings
3. Press Parental Controls
4. Press Unlink Parental Controls
5. Press Next
6. Press Next again
7. Press Approve
8. Bugs+ will restart and Parental Controls will be removed with a very tiny chance of it being added back by the parent since we may prevent it. Your account won’t get banned, there will be no siren, and there will be no timer!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Temporarily disable parental controls to change lots of parent locked settings at once or to avoid restrictions</summary>

If you only need to remove parental controls for a small amount of time, you can remove it without sitting through the setup process all over again. Please note that the deactivation will expire when Bugs+ is restarted or the green flag icon for restarting is pressed once (not with the D key), and Bugs+ quickly restarts to the title screen. This is for one device, but you can temporarily deactivate it for other devices as well. This also requires the Parent PIN.

**Follow these steps to make a temporary deactivation**:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
2. Press Account Settings
3. Press Parental Controls
4. Press Parental Access Mode
5. Enter your PIN
6. Press Approve on the next screen
7. Parental controls will be deactivated.

If you want to re-activate you can restart Bugs+, use the Green Flag icon at the top, or follow these steps:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
2. Press Account Settings
3. Press Parental Controls
4. Press Child Mode. This will only appear if parental controls are enabled but deactivated.
5. No other steps needed, you can continue using it just like before you deactivated it

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unlink Parental Controls Using Your Web Browser</summary>

If all the above fails, you can also remove supervision from your browser. Note that the account will still be banned for a day, but a siren noise won’t play. So we recommend either using the device or using remote supervision if you know the PIN.

Steps (please note this is currently coming soon at the time of writing, it may work it may not work):

1. Go to [Bugs+ Supervision Opt Out - http://bugsplus.me/supervision-opt-out](http://bugsplus.me/supervision-opt-out)
2. Select Next
3. Enter your UserID. You can find this on most AI Summary cards on your profile, by going to Community (cell phone tower icon), click user profiles and click My Profile (if you are using guest mode or another account enter your username \[only works for public profiles for viewing other people’s profiles unless you friended them]) and scroll to the BugAI User AI Summary and locate the userid if displayed after it finished loading. No password will be required.
4. Read what supervision actually means and click Unlink.
5. Read the note saying about the 1 day ban, check the checkboxes and click the OK button.
6. Your devices should get banned and the parental controls should get unlinked. A timer won’t play though.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Need more help?</summary>

You can contact Bugs+ Support for more help. Don’t attempt to mod Bugs+ to unlink it.

</details>

Note that doing any of these options, when there is a active remote supervision login, the parent will be prompted to re-enable supervision or logout from the supervision dashboard and risk loosing supervision on the next supervision dashboard opening. Also, if parental controls don't remove properly after unlinking, please Contact Bugs+ Support, and example of this is the leaderboard hiding feature staying on even after unlinking since currently we don't fix that, but you can contact support if the parents forgot to fix it and you really want to be in the leaderboards.

If you choose to add parental controls back, your original settings will come back and be enforced, but you will have a chance to change them like always with the PIN.

## Setup Parental Controls

You can setup parental controls for your child or teenager.

**How do you want to setup parental controls?**

<details>

<summary>Create a new BugID with parental controls built in</summary>

If you want to create a shiny new BugID for your child that comes with parental controls, simply choose Continue use With BugID on the sign up screen. Is your child currently signed out but is using Guest Mode? Go to the Account tab (the person icon) and press Merge Data To BugID. If you did both of those, choose the birthdate of your child or teenager. Bugs+ supports parental controls for under 18 years old, with no minimum age requirement. Past that age, Bugs+ parental controls may get disabled. Then, verify your age and setup parental controls. Make the most of it by using your computer as the parental controls remote, which grants remote access and more controls.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Add Parental Controls to a existing BugID</summary>

Follow the steps to setup parental controls on a under 18 account:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
2. Press Account Settings
3. Press Setup Parental Controls
4. Press Next
5. Press Verify Now and verify your age to verify you are a parent of that child or teenager.
6. One recommendation will popup about choosing who your child can trade with, press Select and change the setting, or press Skip and ignore it.
7. Setup parental controls! Also, consider downloading Bugs+ on your personal laptop and controlling parental controls remotely. (we will even gift you more controls!)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not supported on Bugs+ 1.0 and 1.1, so make sure to update, but you can still contact support to enable it if you can’t update.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Manage parental controls

You can manage parental controls either on the device or remotely. As a gift for using remote supervision, you can access even more controls since it is less likely to be hacked remotely and for easy access to change settings.

**Choose how you want to manage parental controls:**

<details>

<summary>Directly on the child or teenager’s device</summary>

You can manage certain parental controls on directly on their device by following the following steps:

1. Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
2. On newer Bugs+ versions, Select Account Settings or on older versions, choose from Settings or Account Settings based on what you want to manage
3. On newer versions, select Parental Controls, or on older versions, select a setting you want to manage like you normally set settings
4. On older versions, Enter your Parent PIN if prompted
5. On newer versions, select a parental controls setting to manage, then Enter your Parent PIN when prompted

{% hint style="info" %}
Some features you are used to seeing won’t show on their device since you need to use remote supervision to access more parental controls
{% endhint %}

### When using their device instead of yours, only these parental controls are available:

<i class="fa-sliders-up">:sliders-up:</i> Configure a limited range of parental settings, such as trading (other configurations may not be available)

<i class="fa-hourglass-clock">:hourglass-clock:</i> Enforce learning features only until the end of the day or until stopped using the Parent PIN (only on some older versions not 1.0 or 1.1, so that’s another reason we encourage you to sign up for the remote supervision)

To unlock more control, consider remotely changing settings alongside changing it directly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Using a parent’s computer</summary>

Remotely managing parental controls gives more control over their kids and teenagers since they can manage it even when they don’t have their device nearby, and since there is more features.

**On a parent’s computer, follow these steps:**

1. Download Bugs+ if you don’t already have it on your computer
2. Press Continue With BugID
3. Instead of signing in, select Supervise a Kids Account remotely using this device
4. When prompted, enter your kid or teenager’s username or login email
5. Enter the Parent PIN when prompted
6. Press Start
7. A supervision dashboard should show up, manage your settings there

{% hint style="warning" %}
Wondering why controls are not working? Does your child have Bugs+ 1.0 or 1.1? Then only a small amount (1 or 2) of controls remotely supervised will work, and your child may be changing it. For example, using the disabling trades won’t take effect, but friends only mode will work but that’s only who can friend that person not who they can trade with unlike other versions.
{% endhint %}

</details>

### Devices and services that can’t be supervised or have limited supervision

Here are some devices and services that can’t be supervised via parental controls and what happens when you use them with a Kids Account.

<details>

<summary>Web browsers</summary>

Web browsers that are used to login to only a BugID and not a BugID and Bugs+ at the same time can’t be properly supervised with parental controls, so please use your device’s built in controls and block pages that only use web browsers if you care about this (don’t block the Bugs+ login page).

**None of your controls will be enforced if your child uses their browser. Please speak to the supervised user about if it is abused.**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Versions Bugs+ 1.0 and Bugs+ 1.1</summary>

Bugs+ 1.0 and 1.1 only support limited supervision, so please take care when using those versions, and update your version to the latest at https://bugsplus.me/page?p=download since those versions don’t have update alerts. This is since those versions are early versions of Bugs+ and before proper parental controls.

**Here’s the only settings that we enforce on those versions:**

* Built-in required restrictions that everyone has, including no trade directories, and no direct link to the Bugs+ Forum
* Parent PIN for disabling parental controls and changing the birthdate
* Can’t Update? You can change the settings yourself but they can be changed by your supervised user and does not include the dedicated version for parental control purposes

**Other key points that don’t fit into the unenforced restrictions category:**

* Parental controls can’t be added again or added after skipping the parental controls setup at the start without Bugs+ Support on those versions
* The Parental Controls tab won’t be available, so to unlink controls on those versions, go to Account Settings, press Account Details, press Kids Account Settings, and follow the instructions
* Remote supervision will be available to open but won’t be enforced
* Check Your Child’s Bugs+ Version: Your child may of got Bugs+ earlier, since we don’t provide download links to older versions of Bugs+, or they are not deleting the old versions and are using it as a parental controls bypassing system but you can fix it. Make sure there is a notice on the homepage shoeing something like “This BugID Is Supervised Via Bugs+ Parental Controls!”. Don’t see it? Update and check parental controls settings. You can also use the Check For Updates button on the Home tab (the house icon).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Older versions (not 1.0 and 1.1 but still older)</summary>

Parental controls will work just like it used to on older versions, but if you want to use newer controls or encourage more learning with more features, then you are better of installing updates.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Devices using Guest Mode or another account</summary>

Guest Mode devices or other accounts (unless supervised, but parental controls will be separate) won’t have your supervision settings at all, so make sure to talk to your child about it and find parental controls to approve sign ins and sign outs if available, check in your supervision dashboard.

</details>

### What sections are there in the supervision dashboard?

Here are the sections on the supervision dashboard.

<i class="fa-stars">:stars:</i> **Highlights & Recommendations**

Here you can find recommended parental controls for your child. You can still choose your own as well.

<i class="fa-hourglass-clock">:hourglass-clock:</i> **Time Management**

With the time management area, you can restrict Bugs+ to learning features only until the next day or until stopped, and ban access to Bugs+ until the next day or until stopped. On some Bugs+ versions, Bugs+ will review the history to see if your child does learning or miscellaneous features more.

<i class="fa-mobile">:mobile:</i> **Bugs+ History**

You can scroll through your child or teenager’s Bugs+ history using the Bugs+ History area. This is useful to make decisions, and to protect people.

<i class="fa-user-gear">:user-gear:</i> **Account Settings**

Here you can manage certain settings on the person’s BugID, including your parent PIN and more. This is similar to the feature in Bugs+, but you can manage some of it remotely.

<i class="fa-filter">:filter:</i> **Miscellaneous**

Here you can manage other features that may not fit into a category.
