# Parent Verify

If the child using a BugID is under 12, they will need a parent to verify that they are allowed to use Bugs+, using ID or Face Scan. This service is powered by Kids Web Services. The parent will get an email with the link to start verification. Parents can also use this for users under 18 but over 12 (but it is optional if they are using it on a teenager.)

After verifying, you will be able to setup parental controls using your device or use simple controls on your child‘s device.

Parents will also get notifications if the child did wrong things on Bugs+, with the chance to appeal on behalf of them.

This can be delayed by one day by pressing Maybe Later. After that it will be forced.

To add and revoke rights for your child (permissions, like trading with real players and more), download Bugs+ on your device, choose Continue With BugID and instead of logging in with BugID, choose Supervise a Kids Account remotely using this device (COMING SOON) and follow the steps there, including entering your child’s email or username, and entering the Parent PIN.

If you already verified using that email on another platform, or used it for another Bugs+ Kids Account with Kids Web Services technology, you can skip needing to verify and just need to click on one link in your email.

After verifying, the parent can set a Parent PIN. This cannot be changed after setting it without the help of Bugs+ support (https://bugsplus.me/support). This parent PIN is only needed to perform actions on the device relating to parental controls and won’t affect the parent portal access (which uses email links instead). An example of this is changing the birthdate for the BugID.

Here is a useful page to read with your child: [note.md](note.md "mention")

Now you can login to another account, note that you can login to your Kids Account that with the parental controls you have removed after the next day anytime without loosing any save data.

## Manage parental controls

You can manage parental controls either on the device or remotely. As a gift for using remote supervision, you can access even more controls since it is less likely to be hacked remotely and for easy access to change settings.

**Choose how you want to manage parental controls:**

<summary>Directly on the child or teenager’s device</summary>

You can manage certain parental controls on directly on their device by following the following steps:

1. Go to the Account tab (the person icon)
2. On newer Bugs+ versions, Select Account Settings or on older versions, choose from Settings or Account Settings based on what you want to manage
3. On newer versions, select Parental Controls, or on older versions, select a setting you want to manage like you normally set settings
4. On older versions, Enter your Parent PIN if prompted
5. On newer versions, select a parental controls setting to manage, then Enter your Parent PIN when prompted

{% hint style="info" %}
Some features you are used to seeing won’t show on their device since you need to use remote supervision to access more parental controls
{% endhint %}

### When using their device instead of yours, only these parental controls are available:

<i class="fa-sliders-up">:sliders-up:</i> Configure a limited range of parental settings, such as trading (other configurations may not be available)

<i class="fa-hourglass-clock">:hourglass-clock:</i> Enforce learning features only until the end of the day or until stopped using the Parent PIN

To unlock more control, consider remotely changing settings alongside changing it directly.
