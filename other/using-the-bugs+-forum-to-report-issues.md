# Using the Bugs+ Forum to report issues

You can use the Bugs+ Forum to report issues with Bugs+. In this support post, we will show you how to use the forum.

## Step 1: Sign in or Sign Up to the Forum

You need to sign in to the forum before reporting issues. You can do this by using the Sign In button. Note that the Sign In With BugID button on the forum is broken and you need to have seperate accounts (at the moment).\
