# Leaderboard

To encourage people to learn more about Bugs, there is also a Leaderboard which reflects the amount of Points people get in Bugs+. It usually automatically updates, but sometimes it does not so you can also go to the Community Tab (the cell phone tower icon) and press Leaderboard, then press Leaderboard Sync.

You can view the leaderboard by going to Bugs+ and pressing the Community tab (cell phone tower icon) and press Leaderboard and then press View Leaderboard. You can also find the leaderboard at [https://keepthescore.com/board/mjmytdmzsmxrr/](https://keepthescore.com/board/mjmytdmzsmxrr/?public=true).

## Opt Out (or in)  Of Leaderboard

You can do this via remote supervision, or do it on the device directly (more involved process):

1. Press the Green Flag button at the top for a Quick Restart, while holding U. Continue holding it even while interacting with menus until a Developer Unlock screen comes.
2. Press Y to accept the warning. (or press N to cancel)
3. Press More 2 times.
4. Press Leaderboard visibility
5. Press Hide User On Leaderboard

Developer Unlock can do other things, but it is considered cheating when it's not necessary. It only works with BugID accounts, even though guest users can go on the leaderboard. Don't use Developer Unlock when not needed.
