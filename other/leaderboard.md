# Leaderboard

To encourage people to learn more about Bugs, there is also a Leaderboard which reflects the amount of Points people get in Bugs+. It usually automatically updates, but sometimes it does not so you can also go to the Community Tab (the cell phone tower icon) and press Leaderboard, then press Leaderboard Sync.

You can view the leaderboard by going to Bugs+ and pressing the Community tab (cell phone tower icon) and press Leaderboard and then press View Leaderboard. You can also find the leaderboard at [https://keepthescore.com/board/mjmytdmzsmxrr/](https://keepthescore.com/board/mjmytdmzsmxrr/?public=true).
