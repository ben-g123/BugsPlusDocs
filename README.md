# Welcome

Bugs+ is a free educational game (no general ads, however there is still small not annoying ads in the trade directory!) about Insects & Bugs. There is also trading cards that you can unlock by getting points and using them at the bug point shop. There are also quizzes, AI and info about bugs. Bugs+â€™s account system is called BugID. You can also trade with friends, real people, and AI Bots. There is also an easter event. Bugs+ is Coming Soon. There are also notifications. I am the main Super Admin. Super Admin is an admin, but it has more powers. There may be multiple admins. There is also a Bugs+ Forum & Issue Tracker. There is also bug identification in the More tab (the three dots,) where you can upload a bug image, and it will identify the bug. There are much more features as well.
