# Welcome

Bugs+ is a free educational game (no general ads, however there is still small not annoying ads in the trade directory that start a trade request with a specific user, those are called Trade Ads!) about Insects & Bugs. It also has **Parental Controls**. There is also trading cards that you can unlock by getting points and using them at the bug point shop. There are also quizzes, AI and info about bugs. Bugs+’s account system is called BugID. You can also trade with friends, real people, and AI Bots. There is also an easter event. There are also notifications. I am the main Super Admin. Super Admin is an admin, but it has more powers. There may be multiple admins. There is also a Bugs+ Forum & Issue Tracker. There is also bug identification in the More tab (the three dots,) where you can upload a bug image, and it will identify the bug. There are much more features as well. It also has a real-time scam alerting system. There are also Insect Facts. There are even short educational photos and videos called Bugs+ Memories.

The most useful feature is refunding trading cards and the second most useful feature is parental controls.

<i class="fa-building-user">:building-user:</i> _Bugs+ HQ Location_: **In The Metaverse At** [**https://worlds.viverse.com/Nyw4WnX**](https://worlds.viverse.com/Nyw4WnX)**. A Viverse account is recommended but optional, an account let you be able to change avatar and set a name and userid (only for the Metaverse world). This is different to BugID. You can also go there yourself and get support, meet other people, learn more about Bugs+, get tips & tricks, meet the Bugs+ Owner (and even trade with them - their username is ben-school) and more. It used to be a table at The Hub at Springside West.**

### Quick Start

Here are some articles to get started. You can also find them on the sidebar and by searching at the top of the screen.

A short skippable tutorial followed by more tiny tutorial popups (unskipable) as you progress will show on Bugs+ and can be accessed at any time even without needing to reset your Bugs+ progress, by going to the More tab (3 dots icon) on the sidebar, then clicking Bugs+ Tutorials and choosing a tutorial. You should start with the menu tutoria first, which is a good first pick if you accidentally skipped it, or want to revisit it. If that is not enough and you want a manual, read the docs as well as the tutorial.

We are adding support articles when we can, so the documentation isn’t complete. Feel free to [contact support](https://bugsplus.me/support) when you need to.
