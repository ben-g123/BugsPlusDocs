Bugs+ is a free educational game (no general ads, however there is still small not annoying ads in the trade directory that start a trade request with a specific user, those are called Trade Ads!) about Insects & Bugs. There is also trading cards that you can unlock by getting points and using them at the bug point shop. There are also quizzes, AI and info about bugs. Bugs+’s account system is called BugID. You can also trade with friends, real people, and AI Bots. There is also an easter event. There are also notifications. I am the main Super Admin. Super Admin is an admin, but it has more powers. There may be multiple admins. There is also a Bugs+ Forum & Issue Tracker. There is also bug identification in the More tab (the three dots,) where you can upload a bug image, and it will identify the bug. There are much more features as well. There are also Insect Facts.

<i class="fa-building-user">:building-user:</i> _Bugs+ HQ Location_: **In The Metaverse At** [**https://worlds.viverse.com/RknmoSp**](https://worlds.viverse.com/RknmoSp)**. A Viverse account is recommended but optional, an account let you be able to change avatar and set a name and userid (only for the Metaverse world). This is different to BugID. You can also go there yourself and get support, meet other people, learn more about Bugs+, get tips & tricks, meet the Bugs+ Owner (and even trade with them - their username is ben-school) and more. It used to be a table at The Hub at Springside West.**

### Quick Start

Here are some articles to get started. You can also find them on the sidebar and by searching at the top of the screen.

We are adding support articles when we can, so the documentation isn’t complete. Feel free to [contact support](https://bugsplus.me/support) when you need to.
