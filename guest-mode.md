# Guest Mode

When you are signed out, you can choose to use a BugID or Guest Mode. At any time, you can choose to merge your Guest Mode data to a new BugID by going to th Account tab (the person icon) and pressing Merge Guest Mode data to BugID. See this page for more information - [merge.md](bugid/merge.md "mention").

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not to be confused with [guest.md](bugid/guest.md "mention"). Guest mode is different, since Guest Mode is for not needing to sign into BugID, while Guest Mode is a temporary user to show off Bugs+ to others, for testing or for another person to use Bugs+ temporarily. Learn more at [guest.md](bugid/guest.md "mention").
