# Bugs+ Labs

Bugs+ Labs are experimental, upcoming, and opt-in features ready for public testing. We do not guarantee that the real launch of these features will be the same, or even be added into the actual system. Any user on Bugs+, regradless of the age of their account, or parental controls status (unless the feature may not be for younger kids), can join a lab and test the features inside it.

## Learn how to use Labs, join them and take action on them

<details>

<summary>Why does the lab I want to access the features of have a waitlist?</summary>

Some labs require applying or waiting, while others, are open to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Add me to the waitlist** or **Apply To Access This Feature**, tap it, and we will consider adding you, or adding you to the lab when it gets released to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Join & Enable This Lab’s Features**, tap it and join the lab.

The best thing is that if you join a lab, the Bugs+ Labs features will stay until you leave or the lab shuts down.

If you get waitlisted, the wait won’t take long, so watch for the notification that says you get access!

<summary>Why are there no Labs on the Bugs+ Labs page?</summary>

If there are no labs, there may be some Labs available but we did not roll out access to your user account. Rolling out is very quick, so make sure to stay tuned for new Labs there.

Also, some labs may require parental controls to be disabled, for example, if it has interaction features that we did not approve for kids yet)
