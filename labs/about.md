# Bugs+ Labs

Bugs+ Labs are experimental, upcoming, and opt-in features ready for public testing. We do not guarantee that the real launch of these features will be the same, or even be added into an actual version. Labs may be glitchy at some times, but you can provide feedback and report the glitch at any time. Any user on Bugs+, regradless of the age of their account, or parental controls status (unless the feature may not be for younger kids), can join a lab and test the features inside it. Some Labs have separate requirements, so watch us for those. Bugs+ Labs are made up of individual Labs each with different features, so make sure to opt in to the Labs you want to try out.

### Relation To The Refund Feature

Some of the Labs (not all of them) give you experimental refund features, so you can truely unleash the power of the refund features.

## Learn how to use Labs, join them and take action on them

<details>

<summary>How do I join a Lab?</summary>

**To join a Lab, you will need to follow these steps to choose Labs to opt into:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Choose a lab you want to configure or opt into.
4. Follow the steps on the screen.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the lab I want to access the features of have a waitlist?</summary>

Some labs require applying or waiting, while others, are open to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Add me to the waitlist** or **Apply To Access This Feature**, tap it, and we will consider adding you, or adding you to the lab when it gets released to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Join & Enable This Lab’s Features**, tap it and join the lab.

The best thing is that if you join a lab, the Bugs+ Labs features will stay until you leave or the lab shuts down.

If you get waitlisted, the wait won’t take long, so watch for the notification that says you get access!

Some Labs do this to make it so there is not too many people turning on a Lab in a short amount of time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why are there no Labs on the Bugs+ Labs page?</summary>

If there are no labs, there may be some Labs available but we did not roll out access to your user account. Rolling out is very quick, so make sure to stay tuned for new Labs there.

Also, some labs may require parental controls to be disabled, for example, if it has interaction features that we did not approve for kids yet)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I leave a lab?</summary>

Bugs+ Labs is made up of individual labs. If you want to opt out of a lab, you will need to do them separately. Labs are not enabled by default.

**You can follow these steps to choose a lab to leave:**

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)
2. Press Bugs+ Labs
3. Select the lab you no longer want to be apart of
4. Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of the lab, and remove associated data with the lab you chose.
5. Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to a lab you opted out of, but it won’t contain your lab data.

**How to remove lab or test data when a lab shuts down:**\
If a lab shuts down or converts to an actual feature, we won’t transfer the data, since we may do major updates to it, but we will remove the lab data and if it turns into a feature, you can use new lab data. This is for privacy and compatibility reasons. There is no action that needs to be taken to do this, it is automatic, and we remove data within minutes or even seconds of shutdown.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to reset Bugs+ Labs completely?</summary>

If you just want to opt out of a Lab, please follow the steps for leaving a Lab instead of resetting Bugs+ Labs. That will still remove that Lab’s data if you leave a Lab.

**If you want to reset everything in Bugs+ Labs instead of a simple leave, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots)
2. Press and hold the Bugs+ Labs button
3. After 3 seconds of holding the button, it should turn orange. Continue holding it.
4. After a few extra seconds, it will turn red and a 3 second cancellable countdown will start and it will say to continue holding to reset Bugs+ Labs.
5. When it says Reset Complete, stop holding. The Research & Product Development setting will turn off, all labs will be left, and the lab data will be removed. This won’t delete your game data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I was enjoying the features of a lab, but it just shut down</summary>

Labs may shut down at any time with or without notice. This is since we can no longer handle a Lab, but usually we keep them. However, the best reason could be that the Lab has turned into an actual feature, thanks to your hard work, data and feedback. A simple test can go very far and turn into a feature release. This is not always the reason, but could be a possible reason.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is my data used?</summary>

**Throughout all Labs:**

We don’t track your Bugs+ Labs data, but we may collect some essential data like how many times the user unleashed the power of a Labs feature, or at least tried to. We don’t create ”Lab Profiles” of you to try to track you down.

**Specific Labs:**

You can send Feedback or Glitch Reports to a Lab. We may try to see how many times you used a feature, unleashed the power of a feature, or tried to.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why am I asked to take action within 14 days to avoid loosing access to a Lab?</summary>

Some Labs have strict guideline, while others have soft guidelines. Strict guidelines mean that you always need to follow them, while soft guidelines, you only need to follow the guidelines to maintain access, but you still need to follow the Bugs+ Rules all the time.

This means, if you don’t follow the suggested steps within 14 days, you will loose access to that specific Lab, but you will still maintain access to other Labs if possible. You will get reminders on the first day of that happening, the seventh day, then the last day of when you will loose access.

We will even give you reasoning.

The eligibility countdowns are lab-specific.

You can still use Bugs+ Labs during the countdown, but with limits, and don’t expect to go that far without fixing the issue.

<mark style="color:red;">**What will happen during that time? We won’t allow feedback, Glitch Reports, or collect required data during this time, if you miss the 14 days window, then if you want access back, you will need to go through any waitlists, and do any required steps, and any Lab data will be deleted as well.**</mark>

If you continue to loose access to a Lab a lot of times, you may get banned from Bugs+ since may be taking up resources and if a waitlist the time from the person who has accepted your request and any others for the Lab.

You may also get this notification if you are not using the Lab (for manually used Labs) or on Bugs+ (for continuous reminder or alert Labs, like detecting things in Bugs+, or reminding you of things, the reminder does not need to go off, but you still need to use Bugs+)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Bugs+ Labs Free?</summary>

{% hint style="success" %}
## Yes, Bugs+ Labs Is Free! $0, 0 Bug Points, 0 Stars, and 0 Refund Credits

Bugs+ Labs is always free and it will always be. No credit card required, no hidden fees, just helpful testing. This is like most other features in Bugs+. (I mean by most, things that dont cost Bug Points)
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Available Labs

Here you can find the available labs you can join, and a description.

### Refund Notifications

<details>

<summary>What are Refund Notifications?</summary>

Refund Notifications let you get reminders of when your Collection may be cluttered with duplicate cards, when you are refunding too many cards in a short amount of time (usually 15 minutes or less), or when it may not be a good time to refund (short on cards in your Collection). You get them via popups, and the duplicate detection feature will check for too many duplicates (more than 4 of the same card) regularly, but it is not real time checking, it happens every several minutes.

Refund Notifications are currently the first and main Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to get started with Refund Notifications?</summary>

Firstly, make sure you have an account (also known as BugID), if not, create one and merge signed out data with the new account.&#x20;

**Then, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Refund Notifications
4. Follow the steps on the screen.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I change the thresholds?</summary>

Currently you can’t change the sensitivity or add custom rules of what you think each notification should be, but the good news is that we may add this feature later on, and we have chose the thresholds based on user experience.

You can still send us feedback so we can add this feature or change the default thresholds or send us a Glitch Report, but it needs to involve a glitch to send Glitch Reports.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I send feedback?</summary>

You can send feedback by pressing Send Feedback after getting 3 Refund Notification. You can also send Glitch Reports from that Lab’s settings.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Refund Reminders</summary>

Refund Reminders are part of Refund Notifications. This will give you reminders for when you should start looking through your collection to refund cards. One card with lots of duplicate wont trigger it, so you need at least 2 different cards that have lots of duplicates for the alert to trigger. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I snooze reminders?</summary>

You can snooze reminders until you close Bugs+ by clicking the snooze button on the reminder.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Over-refunding Alerts</summary>

You can get alerts for when you seem to be refunding too many trading cards in a short amount of time. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Wrong Timing Alerts</summary>

You can get alerts for when it may not be a good time for refunding since you are short on trading cards, which could help users build up on trading cards when their Collection is very small, so they are more likely to build up. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Collection Assessment</summary>

With Collection Assessment, it can review your collection and give you a score. You can access this score by going to the Collection tab on the sidebar (the SD card icon) and clicking the circled check mark icon.

You can also see the score when investigating a Refund Notification.

You can also see the score on the Collection Assessment option in Hub Mode.

On the page, you will see a score name (see below), a colour for the score, and there will be 5 rings around the icon, and some will be coloured up or greyed out based on the score.

**What scores can I get?**

* **Good** - No cluttered trading cards (maintaining under 4 trading cards per card type), and at least 3 cards that are not Common or Uncommon. Colour: Green, 5 rings filled up.
* **Good - Collection can be improved** - 1 cluttered trading card (a card type that has more than 4 trading cards), or/and not having at least 2 cards that are not Common or Uncommon. Colour: Green, 4 rings filled up.
* **Average - Collection should be improved** - 2-3 cluttered trading cards (a card type that has more than 4 trading cards). Colour: Yellow, 3 rings filled up.
* **Attention needed - Collection needs improving** - 4-5 cluttered trading cards, or having more than 2000 Bug Points but less than 8000 Bug Points but have less than 10 trading cards. Colour: Orange, 2 rings filled up.
* **Trading card collection emergency - Collection must be improved** - More than 6 cluttered trading cards, or having 8000 Bug Points but have less than 25 trading cards. Colour: Red, 1 ring filled up.

**Taking Action:**

* This is your chance to remove the clutter before you find problems with it. You will get help along the way.
* The way to take action is to unleash the power of the refund assistant, sometimes it requires buying trading cards.
* If you are doing other things, use Hub Mode to multitask.
* The more severe the alert, the faster you should act.
* You might not notice it, but just like real life cleaning, it’s a good idea to clear your collection.

- The scoring assistant will give you more detail, but you can also activate the AI refund assistant as well straight from that screen without needing to go back to the main Collection area.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to turn off Refund Notifications</summary>

To turn off Refund Notifications, follow the same steps for turning off a Lab.

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)

2) Press Bugs+ Labs
3) Select Refund Notifications
4) Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of Refund Notifications. Even though it mentions a reset, it won’t reset anything unless Refund Notifications stores something like settings.
5) Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to Refund Notifications.

</details>

### Personalized Daily Goals

<details>

<summary>What is Personalized Daily Goals?</summary>

When enabled, Once a day, Bugs+ will ask you if you want a daily goal. If so, a short survey will show to personalize the goals further. The goals are based off the survey responses and your data. This is generated by AI. This can help you plan what you will do in Bugs+.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What do Daily Surveys do?</summary>

Daily Surveys will help the AI with selecting a goal for you. You will get this when you choose you want a goal on the popup. They are very short surveys, but they will still help.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I turn off the daily goals?</summary>

To do this, follow the same steps for opting out of a lab.

**You can follow these steps to choose a lab to leave:**

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)
2. Press Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Personalized Daily Goals
4. Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of the lab, and remove associated data with the lab you chose.
5. Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to a lab you opted out of, but it won’t contain your lab data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I get started with the daily goals?</summary>

Firstly, make sure you have an account (also known as BugID), if not, create one and merge signed out data with the new account.&#x20;

**Then, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Personalized Daily Goals
4. Follow the steps on the screen

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I skip a survey?</summary>

You will still get a goal unless you chose No Thanks on the queetion asking if you want a goal for today, but it won’t be personalized, and it will only get it from your game data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I miss the daily goal screen?</summary>

You will need to wait another day. This is since it is a **daily goal** not an on demand goal, but we may change it so if you miss the window or forget, you can get reminders.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Should I skip the goal if I don’t think I need it?</summary>

You should see and screenshot the goal for reference later on today, since you may not know you may need it, but it is up to you.

</details>

### Hub Mode <a href="#research-development" id="research-development"></a>

<details>

<summary>What is Hub Mode?</summary>

Hub Mode lets you nominate a computer that is signed into your BugID to act as a Hub while inactive. The Hub you add is like a second display while you are using your other computer, and you can do lots of things with it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What features can Hub Mode do for you?</summary>

You can do these features, and more, right from your Hub:

* **Check notifications:** There is no longer a need to close what you are doing to check your notifications - you can do it from Hub Mode.
* **Check your Bug Points and Stars balance, plus check your Level & XP**: You can check on your balance without switching windows.
* **Check on the Common & Uncommon (and sometimes other rarity) Shop items**: You can quickly buy Common and Uncommon trading cards from the Hub Display, but nothing else. You need to use the Main Display for the Shop if you want more exclusive items. You will get reminded if you try to get an item that is not available to buy on Hub Mode, and to use your Main Display. **If you have Level 15 in Bugs+, you can also get Rare items from Hub Mode not just only Common & Uncommon.**
* **Use it as an optional second display for some quizzes**: On some quizzes like the ones where you have to find what bug is that, you can put the image bigger on the Hub and the responses and question on the main screen.
* **Check your Collection and refund trading cards**: Need to get some quick Bug Points while you are actively doing another things?  Or, want to see how your collection is going? You also can see your collection and refund trading cards on the Hub.
* **Tips & tricks while you progress through the game**: While you are doing other things, the Hub will show some tips for you to unleash the power of every once in a while. (If you don’t remove the Tips widget, if you did, you will need to add it back.)
* **Hub enhanced or exclusive experiences**: Some parts in Bugs+ take advantage of the second display, or require one.
* **Widgets**: Check on your widgets, whether if it is daily quest widgets, or checking your notification count.

- **And Many More**: There may be some we have not documented, and also, watch out for Lab updates and unleash the power of them!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Set up Hub Mode</summary>

Firstly, make sure you have opted into the Lab, since this is an experiment.

1. Firstly, you will setup the main device. You can always change this later. See the steps below to learn how.
2. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots), and press Setup Hub Mode. Make sure to do this on the Main device (the one you normally use as the main display)
3. Then, confirm that this is the main device. It should say that you will need to do this on the second device. Keep the screen open while you setup the second device.
4. On the Hub Device (the second display), go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon), and press Setup Hub Mode.
5. It should popup saying that there is a main display, and this device will be the Hub Device. You can choose to continue with the Hub Mode setup, or to change the Main display.
6. Choose how to activate Hub Mode. You can either choose after 9 seconds inactivity time, or by tapping Hub Mode on the Home tab on the sidebar (the house icon, but it is opened by default every time you open Bugs+, if you don’t change the tab). You can always activate Hub Mode via the Home tab regardless of setting. Choosing 9 seconds inactivity time will close off what you are doing on Bugs+, so be careful when using this during a quiz or a time sensitive event.
7. Add widgets to Hub Mode, or leave it with the default widgets. Widgets are useful information cards on Hub Mode.
8. Choose every how often to update Hub Mode. You can choose every 4 seconds for people who use Hub Mode a lot, or every 9 seconds for people who don’t usually use hub mode. Timing matters since if you launch an activity that involves Hub Mode, it will wait, but it may be slower for Hub Mode to change to the activity. Hub mode will always update every 4 seconds in a time sensitive activity.
9. Confirm your settings and click Ok.
10. On the first device, press Sync Hub Mode to finish Hub Mode setup, or re-open Bugs+ anytime to sync.

You can always change your settings later.

- We are adding more widgets over time after we have confirmed that the Lab is not shutting down.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I send feedback?</summary>

Watch out for Send Hub Mode Feedback to appear on the Hub Display. This will appear randomly, and will remove itself after a few minutes after appearing, so make sure to look for that. You can get reminders on when you can send feedback by adding the Feedback Opportunities widget. The widget will flash when it’s close to a opportunity to send feedback, so it may not be for you if you don’t want flashing widgets.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there any way to turn this off?</summary>

Yes there is! You can do it with the same way that you turn off a single Lab.\
We would like your feedback if possible, so wait for the feedback period to come first, it’s optional, but appreciated.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does Enhanced Experiences do?</summary>

Enhanced Experiences are areas in Bugs+ that take advantage of 2 computers at the same time, or require one.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I move a refund notification, or a compatible popup to investigate on the Hub Display?</summary>

Some other popups may have a system like this as well.

</details>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unlocking more Hub Mode features along the way</summary>

You can unlock extra Hub Mode features along the way, alongside the built-in features, based on the Level you earned in Bugs+. The Level is your Bugs+ Level, not your Hub Mode-specific rewards tier. Levels are not only for Hub Mode, they also unlock Non-Hub Mode features as well which you can use in the main game not just Hub Mode.

Passing a Level or getting a Level means you can keep the perks of that Level, not just the Hub Mode features.

You will get a notification when you unlocked extra Hub Mode Features.

**Level 1: Built-in Hub Mode Features**

This includes all the features we explained above that did not mention a minimum level. So Enhanced Experiences, Settings, Some Widgets and the other ones that don’t need a level to get. So, all the core features. There is actually a lot of these, and this is what takes up the most of all the features.

This is to make Bugs+ engaging, and to roll out features in Hub Mode over Time, sometimes to make sure people don’t make mistakes with the quickly get Trading Cards from the shop feature.

**Level 10: Check on your Bug Points quickly without needing to go to the Currency & Levels area**

Getting Level 10 in Bugs+, alongside all the other features you unlock like more Shop items that are not related to Hub Mode, **you can also check on your Bug Points quickly without needing to go to Currency & Levels, with the Bug Points Count Widget**.

Even without Level 10, you can still go to Currency & Levels to check on your Bug Points. You can also check your Stars and Levels, alongside Bug Points as well if you use Currency & Levels.

You can get the Levels Widget by adding it in the Widgets area.

**Level 15: Unlock the ability to get Rare cards from Shop area in Hub Mode**

Getting Level 15 in Bugs+, alongside all the other features you unlock like more features that are not related to Hub Mode, **you can also unlock the ability to get Rare cards not just only Common & Uncommon.**

This is very useful to get that Rare card you really want quickly. In this level, you won’t be able to get Ultra Rare, Legandary, Ultra Legendary, and Limited, but you may unlock some of those later. This is since the more you level up, the more likely you are not going to make mistakes on the Shop on the Hub Device.

You still can’t spend Stars on the Shop on Hub Mode, but you can still spend Bug Points. If you need to use Stars, you can still do it on the Main Device.

**Level 20: Unleash the power of the AI Refund Assistant right from your Hub Device**

Getting Level 20 in Bugs+, alongside all the other features you unlock like more features that are not related to Hub Mode, **you can also unlock the ability to use the AI Refund Assistant while the Hub Device is in Hub Model without needing to go to the AI refund assistant on your Main Device.**

Simply activate it from the list icon on the Trading Cards (Collection) area on your Hub Device, or from the Collection Assessment if there is a recommendation.

**Level 25: Get one extra widget space**

Getting Level 25 in Bugs+, alongside all the other features you unlock like more features that are not related to Hub Mode, **you will also get one extra widget space to add to Hub Mode.**

This means you will be able to add 5 widgets maximum instead of 4 widgets maximum. This is your chance to share feedback if 5 is too much, too little or just right.

## Research & Product Development Setting <a href="#research-development" id="research-development"></a>

The Research & Product Development setting is required to use Bugs+ Labs.&#x20;

You can enable or disable it by going to the Account Tab on the sidebar (the person icon) and press Settings, press More, then press Research & Product Development, and review the setting. If disabling and you have Labs opted into, agree that a 14 day timer will start for eligibility purposes.

This will update it for all your devices signed into your account (also known as BugID). If you forget to turn it on, a popup will show reminding you to turn it on will show when you setup Bugs+ Labs, and if you agree, the permission will be enabled for you. Turning it off will make the 14 day window go off for eligibility, just like we said earlier in this support post.

You will also get a chance to review it when you setup your account, but you can always set that setting up later.

This data permission is a privacy feature.
