# Bugs+ Labs

Bugs+ Labs are experimental, upcoming, and opt-in features ready for public testing. We do not guarantee that the real launch of these features will be the same, or even be added into an actual version. Labs may be glitchy at some times, but you can provide feedback and report the glitch at any time. Any user on Bugs+, regradless of the age of their account, or parental controls status (unless the feature may not be for younger kids), can join a lab and test the features inside it. Bugs+ Labs are made up of individual Labs each with different features, so make sure to opt in to the Labs you want to try out.



## Learn how to use Labs, join them and take action on them

<details>

<summary>How do I join a Lab?</summary>

**To join a Lab, you will need to follow these steps to choose Labs to opt into:**

2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Choose a lab you want to configure or opt into.

<summary>Why does the lab I want to access the features of have a waitlist?</summary>

Some labs require applying or waiting, while others, are open to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Add me to the waitlist** or **Apply To Access This Feature**, tap it, and we will consider adding you, or adding you to the lab when it gets released to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Join & Enable This Lab’s Features**, tap it and join the lab.

The best thing is that if you join a lab, the Bugs+ Labs features will stay until you leave or the lab shuts down.

If you get waitlisted, the wait won’t take long, so watch for the notification that says you get access!

<summary>Why are there no Labs on the Bugs+ Labs page?</summary>

If there are no labs, there may be some Labs available but we did not roll out access to your user account. Rolling out is very quick, so make sure to stay tuned for new Labs there.

Also, some labs may require parental controls to be disabled, for example, if it has interaction features that we did not approve for kids yet)

<details>

<summary>How do I leave a lab?</summary>

Bugs+ Labs is made up of individual labs. If you want to opt out of a lab, you will need to do them separately. Labs are not enabled by default.

**You can follow these steps to choose a lab to leave:**

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)
2. Press Bugs+ Labs
3. Select the lab you no longer want to be apart of
4. Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of the lab, and remove associated data with the lab you chose.
5. Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to a lab you opted out of, but it won’t contain your lab data.

**How to remove lab or test data when a lab shuts down:**\
If a lab shuts down or converts to an actual feature, we won’t transfer the data, since we may do major updates to it, but we will remove the lab data and if it turns into a feature, you can use new lab data. This is for privacy and compatibility reasons. There is no action that needs to be taken to do this, it is automatic, and we remove data within minutes or even seconds of shutdown.

<summary>I was enjoying the features of a lab, but it just shut down</summary>

Labs may shut down at any time with or without notice. This is since we can no longer handle a Lab, but usually we keep them. However, the best reason could be that the Lab has turned into an actual feature, thanks to your hard work, data and feedback. A simple test can go very far and turn into a feature release. This is not always the reason, but could be a possible reason.

<details>

<summary>How is my data used?</summary>

**Throughout all Labs:**

We don’t track your Bugs+ Labs data, but we may collect some essential data like how many times the user unleashed the power of a Labs feature, or at least tried to. We don’t create ”Lab Profiles” of you to try to track you down.

**Specific Labs:**

You can send Feedback or Glitch Reports to a Lab. We may try to see how many times you used a feature, unleashed the power of a feature, or tried to.
