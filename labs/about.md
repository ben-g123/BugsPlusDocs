# Bugs+ Labs

Bugs+ Labs are experimental, upcoming, and opt-in features ready for public testing. We do not guarantee that the real launch of these features will be the same, or even be added into an actual version. Labs may be glitchy at some times, but you can provide feedback and report the glitch at any time. Any user on Bugs+, regradless of the age of their account, or parental controls status (unless the feature may not be for younger kids), can join a lab and test the features inside it. Some Labs have separate requirements, so watch us for those. Bugs+ Labs are made up of individual Labs each with different features, so make sure to opt in to the Labs you want to try out.

### Relation To The Refund Feature

Some of the Labs (not all of them) give you experimental refund features, so you can truely unleash the power of the refund features.

## Learn how to use Labs, join them and take action on them

<details>

<summary>How do I join a Lab?</summary>

**To join a Lab, you will need to follow these steps to choose Labs to opt into:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Choose a lab you want to configure or opt into.
4. Follow the steps on the screen.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the lab I want to access the features of have a waitlist?</summary>

Some labs require applying or waiting, while others, are open to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Add me to the waitlist** or **Apply To Access This Feature**, tap it, and we will consider adding you, or adding you to the lab when it gets released to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Join & Enable This Lab’s Features**, tap it and join the lab.

The best thing is that if you join a lab, the Bugs+ Labs features will stay until you leave or the lab shuts down.

If you get waitlisted, the wait won’t take long, so watch for the notification that says you get access!

Some Labs do this to make it so there is not too many people turning on a Lab in a short amount of time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why are there no Labs on the Bugs+ Labs page?</summary>

If there are no labs, there may be some Labs available but we did not roll out access to your user account. Rolling out is very quick, so make sure to stay tuned for new Labs there.

Also, some labs may require parental controls to be disabled, for example, if it has interaction features that we did not approve for kids yet)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I leave a lab?</summary>

Bugs+ Labs is made up of individual labs. If you want to opt out of a lab, you will need to do them separately. Labs are not enabled by default.

**You can follow these steps to choose a lab to leave:**

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)
2. Press Bugs+ Labs
3. Select the lab you no longer want to be apart of
4. Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of the lab, and remove associated data with the lab you chose.
5. Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to a lab you opted out of, but it won’t contain your lab data.

**How to remove lab or test data when a lab shuts down:**\
If a lab shuts down or converts to an actual feature, we won’t transfer the data, since we may do major updates to it, but we will remove the lab data and if it turns into a feature, you can use new lab data. This is for privacy and compatibility reasons. There is no action that needs to be taken to do this, it is automatic, and we remove data within minutes or even seconds of shutdown.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to reset Bugs+ Labs completely?</summary>

If you just want to opt out of a Lab, please follow the steps for leaving a Lab instead of resetting Bugs+ Labs. That will still remove that Lab’s data if you leave a Lab.

**If you want to reset everything in Bugs+ Labs instead of a simple leave, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots)
2. Press and hold the Bugs+ Labs button
3. After 3 seconds of holding the button, it should turn orange. Continue holding it.
4. After a few extra seconds, it will turn red and a 3 second cancellable countdown will start and it will say to continue holding to reset Bugs+ Labs.
5. When it says Reset Complete, stop holding. The Research & Product Development setting will turn off, all labs will be left, and the lab data will be removed. This won’t delete your game data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I was enjoying the features of a lab, but it just shut down</summary>

Labs may shut down at any time with or without notice. This is since we can no longer handle a Lab, but usually we keep them. However, the best reason could be that the Lab has turned into an actual feature, thanks to your hard work, data and feedback. A simple test can go very far and turn into a feature release. This is not always the reason, but could be a possible reason.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is my data used?</summary>

**Throughout all Labs:**

We don’t track your Bugs+ Labs data, but we may collect some essential data like how many times the user unleashed the power of a Labs feature, or at least tried to. We don’t create ”Lab Profiles” of you to try to track you down.

**Specific Labs:**

You can send Feedback or Glitch Reports to a Lab. We may try to see how many times you used a feature, unleashed the power of a feature, or tried to.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why am I asked to take action within 14 days to avoid loosing access to a Lab?</summary>

Some Labs have strict guideline, while others have soft guidelines. Strict guidelines mean that you always need to follow them, while soft guidelines, you only need to follow the guidelines to maintain access, but you still need to follow the Bugs+ Rules all the time.

This means, if you don’t follow the suggested steps within 14 days, you will loose access to that specific Lab, but you will still maintain access to other Labs if possible. You will get reminders on the first day of that happening, the seventh day, then the last day of when you will loose access.

We will even give you reasoning.

The eligibility countdowns are lab-specific.

You can still use Bugs+ Labs during the countdown, but with limits, and don’t expect to go that far without fixing the issue.

<mark style="color:red;">**What will happen during that time? We won’t allow feedback, Glitch Reports, or collect required data during this time, if you miss the 14 days window, then if you want access back, you will need to go through any waitlists, and do any required steps, and any Lab data will be deleted as well.**</mark>

If you continue to loose access to a Lab a lot of times, you may get banned from Bugs+ since may be taking up resources and if a waitlist the time from the person who has accepted your request and any others for the Lab.

You may also get this notification if you are not using the Lab (for manually used Labs) or on Bugs+ (for continuous reminder or alert Labs, like detecting things in Bugs+, or reminding you of things, the reminder does not need to go off, but you still need to use Bugs+)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Bugs+ Labs Free?</summary>

{% hint style="success" %}
## Yes, Bugs+ Labs Is Free! $0, 0 Bug Points, 0 Stars, and 0 Refund Credits

Bugs+ Labs is always free and it will always be. No credit card required, no hidden fees, just helpful testing. This is like most other features in Bugs+. (I mean by most, things that dont cost Bug Points)
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Available Labs

Here you can find the available labs you can join, and a description.

### Refund Notifications

<details>

<summary>What are Refund Notifications?</summary>

Refund Notifications let you get reminders of when your Collection may be cluttered with duplicate cards, when you are refunding too many cards in a short amount of time (usually 15 minutes or less), or when it may not be a good time to refund (short on cards in your Collection). You get them via popups, and the duplicate detection feature will check for too many duplicates (more than 4 of the same card) regularly, but it is not real time checking, it happens every several minutes.

Refund Notifications are currently the first and main Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to get started with Refund Notifications?</summary>

Firstly, make sure you have an account (also known as BugID), if not, create one and merge signed out data with the new account.&#x20;

**Then, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Refund Notifications
4. Follow the steps on the screen.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I change the thresholds?</summary>

Currently you can’t change the sensitivity or add custom rules of what you think each notification should be, but the good news is that we may add this feature later on, and we have chose the thresholds based on user experience.

You can still send us feedback so we can add this feature or change the default thresholds or send us a Glitch Report, but it needs to involve a glitch to send Glitch Reports.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I send feedback?</summary>

You can send feedback by pressing Send Feedback after getting 3 Refund Notification. You can also send Glitch Reports from that Lab’s settings.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Refund Reminders</summary>

Refund Reminders are part of Refund Notifications. This will give you reminders for when you should start looking through your collection to refund cards. One card with lots of duplicate wont trigger it, so you need at least 2 different cards that have lots of duplicates for the alert to trigger. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I snooze reminders?</summary>

You can snooze reminders until you close Bugs+ by clicking the snooze button on the reminder.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Over-refunding Alerts</summary>

You can get alerts for when you seem to be refunding too many trading cards in a short amount of time. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Wrong Timing Alerts</summary>

You can get alerts for when it may not be a good time for refunding since you are short on trading cards, which could help users build up on trading cards when their Collection is very small, so they are more likely to build up. This comes with the Refund Notifications Lab.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to turn off Refund Notifications</summary>

To turn off Refund Notifications, follow the same steps for turning off a Lab.

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)

2) Press Bugs+ Labs
3) Select Refund Notifications
4) Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of Refund Notifications. Even though it mentions a reset, it won’t reset anything unless Refund Notifications stores something like settings.
5) Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to Refund Notifications.

</details>

### Personalized Daily Goals

<details>

<summary>What is Personalized Daily Goals?</summary>

When enabled, Once a day, Bugs+ will ask you if you want a daily goal. If so, a short survey will show to personalize the goals further. The goals are based off the survey responses and your data. This is generated by AI. This can help you plan what you will do in Bugs+.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What do Daily Surveys do?</summary>

Daily Surveys will help the AI with selecting a goal for you. You will get this when you choose you want a goal on the popup. They are very short surveys, but they will still help.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I turn off the daily goals?</summary>

To do this, follow the same steps for opting out of a lab.

**You can follow these steps to choose a lab to leave:**

1. Go to the More sidebar tab (the 3 dots icon)
2. Press Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Personalized Daily Goals
4. Press Opt Out & Reset Lab Data. This will opt you out of the lab, and remove associated data with the lab you chose.
5. Confirm that you want to opt out. You can always come back to a lab you opted out of, but it won’t contain your lab data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I get started with the daily goals?</summary>

Firstly, make sure you have an account (also known as BugID), if not, create one and merge signed out data with the new account.&#x20;

**Then, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon)
2. Tap Bugs+ Labs
3. Select Personalized Daily Goals
4. Follow the steps on the screen

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I skip a survey?</summary>

You will still get a goal unless you chose No Thanks on the queetion asking if you want a goal for today, but it won’t be personalized, and it will only get it from your game data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I miss the daily goal screen?</summary>

You will need to wait another day. This is since it is a **daily goal** not an on demand goal, but we may change it so if you miss the window or forget, you can get reminders.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Should I skip the goal if I don’t think I need it?</summary>

You should see and screenshot the goal for reference later on today, since you may not know you may need it, but it is up to you.

</details>

### Bugs Near Me <a href="#research-development" id="research-development"></a>

<details>

<summary>What is Bugs Near Me?</summary>

If you are in a supported Bugs Near Me location (check while setting up, it will tell you) you can discover what bugs may be near you, with or without needing to go outside. It is also a useful tool for bug catchers, but can be used by anyone.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will Bugs Near Me find all insects near me?</summary>

No. Even since we focus on selected areas, it won't detect all insects, but some at least. This should not be relied while in it's Lab stage.

</details>

## Research & Product Development Setting <a href="#research-development" id="research-development"></a>

The Research & Product Developement setting is required to use Bugs+ Labs.&#x20;

You can enable or disable it by going to the Account Tab on the sidebar (the person icon) and press Settings, press More, then press Research & Product Development, and review the setting. If disabling and you have Labs opted into, agree that a 14 day timer will start for eligibility purposes.

This will update it for all your devices signed into your account (also known as BugID). If you forget to turn it on, a popup will show reminding you to turn it on will show when you setup Bugs+ Labs, and if you agree, the permission will be enabled for you. Turning it off will make the 14 day window go off for eligibility, just like we said earlier in this support post.

You will also get a chance to review it when you setup your account, but you can always set that setting up later.

This data permission is a privacy feature.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need an account (also known as BugID) to turn on this setting.
{% endhint %}
