# Bugs+ Labs

Bugs+ Labs are experimental, upcoming features ready for public testing. We do not guarantee that the real launch of these features will be the same, or even be added into the actual system. Any user on Bugs+, regradless of the age of their account, or parental controls status (unless the feature may not be for younger kids), can join a lab and test the features inside it.

Some labs require applying or waiting, while others, are open to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Add me to the waitlist** or **Apply To Access This Feature**, tap it, and we will consider adding you, or adding you to the lab when it gets released to the whole public. If you are given the option to **Join & Enable This Labâ€™s Features**, tap it and join the lab.
