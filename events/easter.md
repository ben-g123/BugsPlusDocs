# Easter Event

When it is Easter, a Easter special event will be automatically added to Bugs+ until Easter finishes. You will need to press the OK button when it prompts you about that a Easter event has started before you start to find Easter Eggs. You will get a random amount of Easter Credits to start, but you may even get one Easter Egg as a gift as well to start.

You can find them all around the Bugs+ menus. When you find one, click on it to claim it. You can go to the temporary Easter tab that appears on the More tab (the 3 dots icon) to get Easter Credits and more.

This encourages people to learn more about Bugs.

There is also limited edition Bug Trading cards for the Easter event.

The Easter Event resets each year, but the users can keep the Trading Cards you got from the event and limited edition items.

In some Bugs+ Easter Events a separate leaderboard will be made relating to Easter Credits.
