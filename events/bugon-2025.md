# BugOn 2025

BugOn is a limited time event in 2025 where you can get valuable rewards for doing tasks. For this one, (unlike the Easter Event), but we will make a **dedicated area later**, there is no popup or dedicated event area since it is just doing tasks not anything else like Easter, but you will get notifications, emails and a Youtube Video on our Youtube Channel will come up. There is one BugOn each year, sometimes even more.
