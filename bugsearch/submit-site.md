## Step 1: Make sure you and your site is eligible

To be eligible, you need to have owner, manager or administration access to the website or blog you want to submit.

For your website to be eligible, your website needs to follow these requirements:

* Reliable Source - Your website must have reliable and accurate information. This is a general rule so all the info on BugSearch is correct.
* No Swearing (and no bad content) - Your website must not contain inappropriate content. - This is a general rule since kids may use BugSearch as well as adults and teenagers.
* No or Limited Adverts - Your website should not have ad banners, but you can still have them in a few conditions like that there are small amounts, and not annoying. Annoying ads include popups (newsletter popups are fine), adwalls ,and ads sticking to the bottom of the screen (anchor ads).
* About Insects - The website or website path (the slash then the content) you submit must be about insects. If only some parts of your website are about insects, please submit only the sub-paths (like /insects then the content) or manually submit pages about insects. - This is a general rule, of course.
* Don't use AI - It's simple as that, don't use AI, or request unindexing on pages that have AI content.
* Enough content for enough time - Your website must be on the web for more than 1 month, and must have enough content.
