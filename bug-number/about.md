# +bug Numbers

When you have a BugID, you can free or paid (with Bug Points) claim a +bug Phone Number. The catch is that only people with BugIDs can send messages to it or ping it, and it has to be done in Bugs+.

### Example Use Cases

* **Login with Bugs+** - You can get codes sent to your +bug Phone Number to login quickly without passwords and other 2FA.
* **Organizing trades** - You can unleash the power of a +bug Number to organize trades and increase the trade acceptance rate.
* **Send friend requests even when you don't have their username** - All you need is their +bug Number.
* **And many more!** - What are your creative ideas you could use it for?

### Spam Prevention Toolkit

Here are some ways we prevent spam and scams from coming to and from +bug numbers.

* **Ask To See +bug Number** - With Ask To See +bug Number, which is enabled by default and can be disabled, the user can ask to see your +bug Number, directly from your profile, when they don't have your +bug Number. If the user already has it, there may be spam or scams attempted, but they will be most likely to be blocked by our other tools.
* **Anti-Scam** - Even though this is not apart of +bug Numbers, it can be used with it. This means that when someone sends you a scammy trade and you engage on it, or the user sounds sussy and you are about to accept it, you will get warnings. You can also configure it, see this page - [Anti-Scam Level](../trading/change-the-anti-scam-level.md).
* **And many more to come** - Remember To Stay Tuned!
