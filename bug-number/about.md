# +bug Numbers

When you have a BugID, you can free or paid (with Bug Points) claim a +bug Phone Number. The catch is that only people with BugIDs can send messages to it or ping it, and it has to be done in Bugs+.

Example Use Cases:

* **Login with Bugs+** - You can get codes sent to your +bug Phone Number to login quickly without passwords and other 2FA.
* **Organizing trades** - You can unleash the power of a +bug Number to organize trades and increase the trade acceptance rate.
* **Send friend requests even when you don't have their username** - All you need is their +bug Number.
* **And many more!** - What are your creative ideas you could use it for?
