# Bugs+ Earn

{% hint style="info" %}
### Bugs+ Moth Exclusive Feature

This feature is included with a [moth.md](../gameplay/moth.md "mention") subscription (not Bugs+ Moth Basic). It is easy to get and only requires Bug Points. It is not available in the Bugs+ Moth trial version because of past abuse.

## Bugs+ NOT Earn Shutting Down Temporarily

**Update:** We are keeping Bugs+ Earn, and still add the promised addition as a second Bugs+ Earn program, which is the community via insect fact posting, it will be another Bugs+ Earn program, which you will be able to apply for separately in the Bugs+ Earn then choose the community posting option, but uses the same dashboard and same structure but for community posting.

Old timeline (does not apply anymore)

Bugs+ Earn will be shutting down until further notice, and there will also be something newer that better helps the community via insect fact posting that includes earning and Bugs+ Moth won't be needed, as a compensation, and it will be kept even if Bugs+ Earn comes back. **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**

We will add Bugs+ Earn again in the future, and we are hoping so, so we don't delete Bugs+ Earn, we will just show a message saying that "Bugs+ Earn has been shut down, but we will add it in the future" **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**

**Timeline:**

* **28 August 2025** - Bugs+ Earn shutdown announced, and new signups are not encouraged **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **6 September 2025** - New signups will be blocked, even if you left and want to rejoin **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **12 September 2025** - You won't be able to switch tiers, or signup for Instant Payouts, or trigger any actions in Bugs+ Earn that needs approval **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **13 September 2025** - The Bugs+ Earn community edition won't be available, and will be revoked for existing users **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **16 September 2025** - Everyone will be downgraded and locked to the Tier 1, the Starter Pack, and any Instant Payouts permissions will be removed **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **20 September 2025** - All pending payouts will be paid out instantly, and Bugs+ Earn will be locked for all users, with all user's Bugs+ Earn rights revoked, and Bugs+ Earn will be shut down and hidden completely in the next update **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
* **Sometime In 2026** - Bugs+ Earn will come back, better than ever. **(Bugs+ Earn is not shutting down)**
{% endhint %}

Currently, Bugs+ Earn is the only Bugs+ Earn earning program. In the future, we will make other earning programs for Bugs+ Earn.

Bugs+ Earn also provides a version for notable people in the Bugs+ community, called Bugs+ Earn Community Edition. The difference is that it does not require a active Bugs+ Moth subscription which makes it easier to get points toward Bugs+ Moth and other things you can get with Bug Points and you can get higher payouts and higher instant payouts. You will start with a Core Tier with Instant Payouts, then you can apply for other tiers later.

## Payouts

You could earn up to 1700 Bug Points in a single task. Instant payouts are eligible for people providing helpful data continuously. You can get a Instant Payout for payouts up to 800 Bug Points. Payouts (not instant ones) could pend for up to 2 days before being approved.

## What If I stop Using Bugs+ Moth?

If you stop using Bugs+ Moth (if you have the Community edition, this does not count), usually due to cancelling it, downgrading to Bugs+ Moth basic or the subscription expriring and not having enough Bug Points to get the subscription, then you have 7 Days to get Bugs+ Moth again or apply for the Community Edition. During this time, you will still have access to Bugs+ Earn. If you fail to do so, then your Bugs+ Earn subscription will be paused. If you still did not get Bugs+ Moth, or apply for the Community Edition, within 14 days after it pausing, then you will loose your tier and need ot reapply if you decide to come back to Bugs+ Earn after that time.

## Screening Questions

Before you can start earning, you need to do 3 screening questions to verify that you follow the rules. You won't earn Bug Points the screening questions but if accepted by a Bugs+ Admin, you will be able to do more tasks and start earning Bug Points.

## Find the Bugs+ Earn Dashboard

Go to the More tab (the 3 dots) and click Bugs+ Earn to find your Bugs+ Earn dashboard.

## What types of tasks are there?

<i class="fa-calendar-exclamation">:calendar-exclamation:</i> Update outdated data, and confirm existing data

<i class="fa-sd-card">:sd-card:</i> Help with descriptions for upcoming Trading Cards

<i class="fa-comments-question-check">:comments-question-check:</i> Answer other people's questions about Insects. If there is a off topic or inappropriate question that you have found, then you can report it at the Reports System or Bugs+ Support.

<i class="fa-message-pen">:message-pen:</i> Provide feedback about trading cards and make helpful edit requests. You donâ€™t need Bugs+ Earn to make edit requests (since you can use Bugs+ Support), but with it you can suggest edits and also earn Bug Points from your helpful edit requests.

## What approval statuses are there?

Here are the screening question approval statuses:

<i class="fa-circle-pause">:circle-pause:</i> <mark style="color:$info;">**Not Started**</mark> - This means that the user has not done the Screening Questions

<i class="fa-spinner-scale">:spinner-scale:</i> <mark style="color:purple;">**Pending**</mark> - This means that the user has started, but still needs to do the Screening Questions

<i class="fa-clock-rotate-left">:clock-rotate-left:</i> <mark style="color:yellow;">**Review Requested**</mark> - This means you have submitted the Screening Questions but the Bugs+ Admins still need to review it

<i class="fa-circle-xmark">:circle-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - Low Quality**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because it does not meet our quality requirements

<i class="fa-circle-xmark">:circle-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - User Too New**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because the user is too new to use Bugs+ Earn. The minimum amount of time on Bugs+ required to apply for the core tier in Bugs+ Earn is 1 month and 12 days. Other tiers may have different requirements. You can do the screening questions and submit them when you are too new, but its very rare that you will get accepted

<i class="fa-hexagon-xmark">:hexagon-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - Bugs+ Rules Violation**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because the response the user gave breaks the Bugs+ Rules, and additional action may be taken

<i class="fa-square-check">:square-check:</i> <mark style="color:green;">**Accepted**</mark> - This means that the application has been approved and the user can use Bugs+ Earn.

## Appeal Our Decision

If you get the Rejected status in Bugs+ Earn, then you have 2 choices. Here are the choices you can use to get another go so you may be able to get access to Bugs+ Earn.

* <i class="fa-gavel">:gavel:</i> **Submit an Appeal** - You can either go to the Account tab (the person icon) then press Account Status & Appeals and appeal it there or contact Bugs+ Support at https://bugsplus.me/support and appeal it. You can also go to one of those tabs by going to the Bugs+ Earn interface and pressing Appeal.
* <i class="fa-arrow-rotate-left">:arrow-rotate-left:</i> **Redo the Screening Questions** - You can also redo the  screening questions and provide better answers this time.
