# Bugs+ Earn

{% hint style="info" %}
### Bugs+ Moth Exclusive Feature

This feature is included with a [moth.md](../gameplay/moth.md "mention") subscription (not Bugs+ Moth Basic). It is easy to get and only requires Bug Points. It is not available in the Bugs+ Moth trial version because of past abuse.
{% endhint %}

Bugs+ Earn is a special program that allows you to earn Bug Points by simply helping other people with insects and confirming data to make the data up-to-date. It is exclusive to Bugs+ Moth. The data provided may be featured either publicly or privately or not at all based on data quality.

Currently, Bugs+ Earn is the only Bugs+ Earn earning program. In the future, we will make other earning programs for Bugs+ Earn.

Bugs+ Earn also provides a version for notable people in the Bugs+ community, called Bugs+ Earn Community Edition. The difference is that it does not require a active Bugs+ Moth subscription which makes it easier to get points toward Bugs+ Moth and other things you can get with Bug Points and you can get higher payouts and higher instant payouts.

## Payouts

You could earn up to 1700 Bug Points in a single task. Instant payouts are eligible for people providing helpful data continuously. You can get a Instant Payout for payouts up to 800 Bug Points. Payouts (not instant ones) could pend for up to 2 days before being approved.

## Screening Questions

Before you can start earning, you need to do 3 screening questions to verify that you follow the rules. You won't earn Bug Points the screening questions but if accepted by a Bugs+ Admin, you will be able to do more tasks and start earning Bug Points.

## Find the Bugs+ Earn Dashboard

Go to the More tab (the 3 dots) and click Bugs+ Earn to find your Bugs+ Earn dashboard.

## What types of tasks are there?

<i class="fa-calendar-exclamation">:calendar-exclamation:</i> Update outdated data, and confirm existing data

<i class="fa-sd-card">:sd-card:</i> Help with descriptions for upcoming Trading Cards

<i class="fa-comments-question-check">:comments-question-check:</i> Answer other people's questions about Insects. If there is a off topic or inappropriate question that you have found, then you can report it at the Reports System or Bugs+ Support.

<i class="fa-message-pen">:message-pen:</i> Provide feedback about trading cards and make helpful edit requests. You donâ€™t need Bugs+ Earn to make edit requests (since you can use Bugs+ Support), but with it you can suggest edits and also earn Bug Points from your helpful edit requests.

## What approval statuses are there?

Here are the screening question approval statuses:

<i class="fa-circle-pause">:circle-pause:</i> <mark style="color:$info;">**Not Started**</mark> - This means that the user has not done the Screening Questions

<i class="fa-spinner-scale">:spinner-scale:</i> <mark style="color:purple;">**Pending**</mark> - This means that the user has started, but still needs to do the Screening Questions

<i class="fa-clock-rotate-left">:clock-rotate-left:</i> <mark style="color:yellow;">**Review Requested**</mark> - This means you have submitted the Screening Questions but the Bugs+ Admins still need to review it

<i class="fa-circle-xmark">:circle-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - Low Quality**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because it does not meet our quality requirements

<i class="fa-circle-xmark">:circle-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - User Too New**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because the user is too new to use Bugs+ Earn. The minimum amount of time on Bugs+ required to apply for the core tier in Bugs+ Earn is 1 month and 12 days. Other tiers may have different requirements. You can do the screening questions and submit them when you are too new, but its very rare that you will get accepted

<i class="fa-hexagon-xmark">:hexagon-xmark:</i> <mark style="color:red;">**Rejected - Bugs+ Rules Violation**</mark> - This means that the admins has rejected the request because the response the user gave breaks the Bugs+ Rules, and additional action may be taken

<i class="fa-square-check">:square-check:</i> <mark style="color:green;">**Accepted**</mark> - This means that the application has been approved and the user can use Bugs+ Earn.

## Appeal Our Decision

If you get the Rejected status in Bugs+ Earn, then you have 2 choices. Here are the choices you can use to get another go so you may be able to get access to Bugs+ Earn.

* <i class="fa-gavel">:gavel:</i> **Submit an Appeal** - You can either go to the Account tab (the person icon) then press Account Status & Appeals and appeal it there or contact Bugs+ Support at https://bugsplus.me/support and appeal it. You can also go to one of those tabs by going to the Bugs+ Earn interface and pressing Appeal.
* <i class="fa-arrow-rotate-left">:arrow-rotate-left:</i> **Redo the Screening Questions** - You can also redo the  screening questions and provide better answers this time. You have unlimited attempts, but continuously failing the screening questions with extremely low quality can result in punishments.

## Bugs+ Earn Tiers

We also have multiple tiers, some of them let you unlock access earlier, one of them has the core features, while others add more features.\
More information is coming soon.
