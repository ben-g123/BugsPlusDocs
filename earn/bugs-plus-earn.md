# Bugs+ Earn

{% hint style="info" %}
### Bugs+ Moth Exclusive Feature

This feature is included with a [moth.md](../gameplay/moth.md "mention") subscription (not Bugs+ Moth Basic). It is easy to get and only requires Bug Points. It is not available in the Bugs+ Moth trial version because of past abuse.
{% endhint %}

Bugs+ Earn is a special program that allows you to earn Bug Points by simply helping other people with insects and confirming data to make the data up-to-date. It is exclusive to Bugs+ Moth. The data provided may be featured either publicly or privately or not at all based on data quality.

Currently, Bugs+ Earn is the only Bugs+ Earn earning program. In the future, we will make other earning programs for Bugs+ Earn.

## Payouts

You could earn up to 1700 Bug Points in a single task. Instant payouts are eligible for people providing helpful data continuously. You can get a Instant Payout for payouts up to 800 Bug Points. Payouts (not instant ones) could pend for up to 2 days before being approved.

## Screening Questions

Before you can start earning, you need to do 3 screening questions to verify that you follow the rules. You won't earn Bug Points the screening questions but if accepted by a Bugs+ Admin, you will be able to do more tasks and start earning Bug Points.
