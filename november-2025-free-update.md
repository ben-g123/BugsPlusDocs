# Bugs+ Free Update Coming Soon

A free update in Bugs+ is coming soon at 19th November 2025, with some new features coming that may totally change how you play Bugs+. Let’s talk about what we will be adding. Even though Bugs+ is free, we call it a free update to confirm to users they don’t need to pay anything to unlock the features of the update when it releases.

We are introducing 5 new major features that will totally change how you use Bugs+, but in a good way. You will definitly want to see this!

### Difficulty Setting

We will be adding a difficulty setting to Bugs+. This lets you change how hard or easy it is to play Bugs+. When the update is released, you will be able to go to the Account tab on the sidebar (the person icon), press Settings, press Change Difficulty and set a difficulty. You will be asked to set one when you set up Bugs+ or when you get the update.

Here are the difficulties:

* Easy
* Normal
* More involved

And here is what they do:

#### Easy

The Easy option will:

* If you start Bugs+ (but not if you set it to easy later) with the easy option, you will get a random 7 cards with this as the rarity - 3 Common cards, 2 Uncommon cards, and 2 Rare cards as a boost to start with.
* You will have an easier time getting rewards from quizzes. 1 correct answer will be added to the results making it easier to get quiz or event rewards that depend on how many correct answers you have.
* More value for less Bug Points or Stars - You will get an extra 1 trading card added to each bulk trading card pack you get from the Shop.
* Bug Points, Stars, and Levels & XP are easier to get more of - When you get in-game currency, you will get a small extra bonus added to that amount.

But there is a catch - Some limited time events, competition-based features, or other things may require extra work to unlock or get rewards from, or you may won’t be able to use them at all until you change it to another difficulty. Some normal features may be locked until you change your difficulty to Normal or More Involved.

You won’t be able to switch to Easy mode after unlocking one or more of these:

* Level 85 or more
* Unlocking some major parts in the game and confirming may lock Easy mode earlier.

If you are on Easy mode and unlock one or more of the things above, you will be moved to Normal Mode.

#### Normal

This is the default setting, and it is the normal gameplay experience that was and is already available. It will keep all the normal gameplay features, and won’t change anything for normal play.

#### More Involved

This is the hardest setting for players who want to make the game harder while truly unleashing the power.

The More Involved option will:

* Quizzes will have a 30 to 50 second time limit based on the content and length
* You may loose Levels over time if you have not been truly unleashing the power of Bugs+ Features that are meant to help you progress through Bugs+
* The Trading Card limit will decrease to 65 Trading Cards instead of 85 trading cards.

But, this comes with rewards - using the More Involved mode will get you some Bug Points every now and then.

You will need to unlock it by getting Level 25 or higher, then you can make a decision about if you want to turn on More Involved.

### Trading Card Limit

To encourage users to avoid clutter, there will be a Trading Card limit when this free update launches. It is different based on the difficulty level the user set. When you reach the limit, you will only be able to use the Collection and refund trading cards.

**What is the Trading Card limit?**

* If you use the Easy or Normal mode, the limit will be 85 Trading Cards.
* If you use the More Involved mode, the trading card limit will be 65 trading cards.

#### Check the progress through the limit

To check the progress towards limit plus any warnings after you closed the popup, when the update launches, clicking on the Collection tab on the sidebar (the SD card icon), where you see how many cards you have, there will be a progress bar. It changes color, changes the look, adds text and other things as you go towards the limit.

#### Limit Alerts along the way

We won’t just limit the amount of trading cards you have without notice - we will give you clear warning, like this:

* **You have 50 trading cards or more (or 35 if you have More Involved on)** - We will give you a popup warning, plus you will get a yellow warning progress bar on your Collection.
* **You have 70 trading cards or more (or 50 if you have More Involved on)** - We will give you a more serious and detailed warning popup, plus you will get a red progress bar on your collection
* **You have reached the trading card limit** - You will get a full screen popup asking you to refund some trading cards to continue collecting. This is a perfect chance for you to improve your collection the next time. If you don’t, you will only be able to look at your Collection and refund trading cards, nothing else. The AI refund assistant, if provided will also be available during that time. It’s like a full lockdown with a chance of clean up your Collection. If needed, a detailed tutorial on how to refund cards will also be provided.

#### What if I update and I had a really big collection before then?

If you have too much to refund (more than 5 copies), you will be able to reset your collection and get 40 instant Rare cards after resetting, or continue with the refund and make it a big spring cleaning session.

### Gift Boxes

After updating to the free update coming soon, as you progress through Bugs+, you will get Gift Boxes. Gift Boxes are bundles of rewards you normally get, usually Bug Points, Stars, Levels & XP, trading cards, daily quest refreshers, the crafting materials that we will talk about soon and more. They can be received from daily quests, limited time events, but more frequently, plus as a gift for levelling up in Bugs+.

They will popup on the screen when unlocked, with info on the rewards, and a button to claim them.

If you get daily quest refreshers but did not unlock the feature yet from leveling up, you won’t get that specific daily quest refresher set, and it won’t mention it, but you will still be able to get new daily refreshers once unlocked.

They also may contain helpful tips or information in the game, accessible from the new Tips menu by going to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon) and pressing Unlocked Tips, Tricks and Info. They may not always be tips, they may also be information, facts, and even a guide for getting a specific valuable trading cards (like a treasure map, and we mean it, you will absolutely love it), and the tips you can look at straight away, plus use it as a helpful reference or tip later.

### Tips Camera

This is a total game changer! You may find tips around while you are playing Bugs+, they can be anywhere, even in your collection, when you are playing quizzes, even in settings, and any unexpected area. However, you will only be able to see the tips if you use your Tips Camera.

Just like the tips inside Gift Boxes, they may not always be tips, they may also be information, facts, and even a guide for getting a specific valuable trading cards (like a treasure map, and we mean it, you will absolutely love it).

Pressing on the tip will let you take a photo of the info. After pressing on it, make sure to press Snap A Photo Of This Tip.

Out of random, one of these may happen:

* A Tip may appear on your screen, and added to the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area. This is the most common thing that we think will happen.
* If you are lucky, a Gift Box will appear on your screen, along with a Tip appearing on your screen, and being added to the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area.
* Or, the camera may not snap the photo correctly. If that happens, you won’t get any tip or Gift Box. Don’t worry, you can still find more tips. You will also get 275 Bug Points as a sorry gift for the photo not being taken properly. This happens as random, just like other ones.

Jut like tips in gift boxes and the go-to guide will get for updating within 2 months, you can see your unlocked tips at the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area.

But, the catch is that you need to unlock the Tips Camera first to take photos of tips. To unlock it, you need to get **Level 16**. Upon getting **Level 16**, you will get a Gift Box with 650 Bug Points, 5 Stars, plus the Tips Camera that you needed to unlock, and a guide about using the camera you can read right away and reference to it later. If you already have **Level 16 or more** and then update, you will get the Tips Camera straight away, plus the guide, but not in the form of a gift box.

### Crafting System

We will be adding a crafting system to Bugs+ in the next free update. You will be able to find crafting materials from Gift Boxes, then you can craft trading cards, and in-game items. We may introduce exclusive items or trading cards that you can only get from the crafting system. You will be able to use the crafting materials by going to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon), then press Material Exchange.

However, crafting has a time limit, based on how valuable the resource you are crafting (we make it based off rarity, sometimes valuable things is cheap, which is good). And, there is a limit on how much you can craft at once.

**What you can make with Material Exchange:**

Currently, you will be able to craft:

**How long does it take to craft, and how many materials does each one cost?**
