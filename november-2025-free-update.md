# Bugs+ Free Update Coming Soon

A free update in Bugs+ is coming soon at 19th November 2025, with some new features coming that may totally change how you play Bugs+. Let’s talk about what we will be adding. Even though Bugs+ is free, we call it a free update to confirm to users they don’t need to pay anything to unlock the features of the update when it releases.

We are introducing 7 new major features that will totally change how you use Bugs+, plus 2 ease of use improvements, but in a good way. This makes a total of 9 useful features. You will definitly want to see this! It gotta help you unleash the power of Bugs+!

### Difficulty Setting

We will be adding a difficulty setting to Bugs+. This lets you change how hard or easy it is to play Bugs+. When the update is released, you will be able to go to the Account tab on the sidebar (the person icon), press Settings, press Change Difficulty and set a difficulty. You will be asked to set one when you set up Bugs+ or when you get the update.

Here are the difficulties:

* Easy
* Normal
* More involved

And here is what they do:

#### Easy

The Easy option will:

* If you start Bugs+ (but not if you set it to easy later) with the easy option, you will get a random 7 cards with this as the rarity - 3 Common cards, 2 Uncommon cards, and 2 Rare cards as a boost to start with.
* You will have an easier time getting rewards from quizzes. 1 correct answer will be added to the results making it easier to get quiz or event rewards that depend on how many correct answers you have.
* More value for less Bug Points or Stars - You will get an extra 1 trading card added to each bulk trading card pack you get from the Shop.
* Bug Points, Stars, and Levels & XP are easier to get more of - When you get in-game currency, you will get a small extra bonus added to that amount.

But there is a catch - Some limited time events, competition-based features, or other things may require extra work to unlock or get rewards from, or you may won’t be able to use them at all until you change it to another difficulty. Some normal features may be locked until you change your difficulty to Normal or More Involved.

You won’t be able to switch to Easy mode after unlocking one or more of these:

* Level 85 or more
* Unlocking some major parts in the game and confirming may lock Easy mode earlier.

If you are on Easy mode and unlock one or more of the things above, you will be moved to Normal Mode.

#### Normal

This is the default setting, and it is the normal gameplay experience that was and is already available. It will keep all the normal gameplay features, and won’t change anything for normal play.

#### More Involved

This is the hardest setting for players who want to make the game harder while truly unleashing the power.

The More Involved option will:

* Quizzes will have a 30 to 50 second time limit based on the content and length
* You may loose Levels over time if you have not been truly unleashing the power of Bugs+ Features that are meant to help you progress through Bugs+
* The Trading Card limit will decrease to 65 Trading Cards instead of 85 trading cards.

But, this comes with rewards - using the More Involved mode will get you some Bug Points every now and then.

You will need to unlock it by getting Level 25 or higher, then you can make a decision about if you want to turn on More Involved.

### Trading Card Limit

To encourage users to avoid clutter, there will be a Trading Card limit when this free update launches. It is different based on the difficulty level the user set. When you reach the limit, you will only be able to use the Collection and refund trading cards.

**What is the Trading Card limit?**

* If you use the Easy or Normal mode, the limit will be 85 Trading Cards.
* If you use the More Involved mode, the trading card limit will be 65 trading cards.

#### Check the progress through the limit

To check the progress towards limit plus any warnings after you closed the popup, when the update launches, clicking on the Collection tab on the sidebar (the SD card icon), where you see how many cards you have, there will be a progress bar. It changes color, changes the look, adds text and other things as you go towards the limit.

#### Limit Alerts along the way

We won’t just limit the amount of trading cards you have without notice - we will give you clear warning, like this:

* **You have 50 trading cards or more (or 35 if you have More Involved on)** - We will give you a popup warning, plus you will get a yellow warning progress bar on your Collection.
* **You have 70 trading cards or more (or 50 if you have More Involved on)** - We will give you a more serious and detailed warning popup, plus you will get a red progress bar on your collection
* **You have reached the trading card limit** - You will get a full screen popup asking you to refund some trading cards to continue collecting. This is a perfect chance for you to improve your collection the next time. If you don’t, you will only be able to look at your Collection and refund trading cards, nothing else. The AI refund assistant, if provided will also be available during that time. It’s like a full lockdown with a chance of clean up your Collection. If needed, a detailed tutorial on how to refund cards will also be provided.

#### Any other options?

Yes, you can also optionally reset your collection. This will only reset trading cards, nothing else. But, the payoff is time saved, and also you will get lots of trading cards in return - 30 Rare cards and 10 legendary. Warning that this may trigger a clutter alert if you have Refund Notifications, or this may cause general clutter issues.

### Gift Boxes

After updating to the free update coming soon, as you progress through Bugs+, you will get Gift Boxes. Gift Boxes are bundles of rewards you normally get, usually Bug Points, Stars, Levels & XP, trading cards, daily quest refreshers, the crafting materials that we will talk about soon and more. They can be received from daily quests, limited time events, but more frequently, plus as a gift for levelling up in Bugs+.

They will popup on the screen when unlocked, with info on the rewards, and a button to claim them.

If you get daily quest refreshers but did not unlock the feature yet from leveling up, you won’t get that specific daily quest refresher set, and it won’t mention it, but you will still be able to get new daily refreshers once unlocked.

They also may contain helpful tips or information in the game, accessible from the new Tips menu by going to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon) and pressing Unlocked Tips, Tricks and Info. They may not always be tips, they may also be information, facts, and even a guide for getting a specific valuable trading cards (like a treasure map, and we mean it, you will absolutely love it), and the tips you can look at straight away, plus use it as a helpful reference or tip later.

Make sure to press Claim Rewards, since rewards from Guft Boxes won’t be auto claimed.

### Tips Camera

This is a total game changer! You may find tips around while you are playing Bugs+, they can be anywhere, even in your collection, when you are playing quizzes, even in settings, and any unexpected area. However, you will only be able to see the tips if you use your Tips Camera.

Just like the tips inside Gift Boxes, they may not always be tips, they may also be information, facts, and even a guide for getting a specific valuable trading cards (like a treasure map, and we mean it, you will absolutely love it).

Pressing on the tip will let you take a photo of the info. After pressing on it, make sure to press Snap A Photo Of This Tip.

Out of random, one of these may happen:

* A Tip may appear on your screen, and added to the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area. This is the most common thing that we think will happen.
* If you are lucky, a Gift Box will appear on your screen, along with a Tip appearing on your screen, and being added to the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area.
* Or, the camera may not snap the photo correctly. If that happens, you won’t get any tip or Gift Box. Don’t worry, you can still find more tips. You will also get 275 Bug Points as a sorry gift for the photo not being taken properly. This happens as random, just like other ones.

Jut like tips in gift boxes and the go-to guide will get for updating within 2 months, you can see your unlocked tips at the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area.

But, the catch is that you need to unlock the Tips Camera first to take photos of tips. To unlock it, you need to get **Level 16**. Upon getting **Level 16**, you will get a Gift Box with 650 Bug Points, 5 Stars, plus the Tips Camera that you needed to unlock, and a guide about using the camera you can read right away and reference to it later. If you already have **Level 16 or more** and then update, you will get the Tips Camera straight away, plus the guide, but not in the form of a gift box.

### Crafting System

We will be adding a crafting system to Bugs+ in the next free update. You will be able to find crafting materials from Gift Boxes, then you can craft trading cards, and in-game items. We may introduce exclusive items or trading cards that you can only get from the crafting system. You will be able to use the crafting materials by going to the More tab on the sidebar (the 3 dots icon), then press Material Exchange.

However, crafting has a time limit, based on how valuable the resource you are crafting (we make it based off rarity, sometimes valuable things is cheap, which is good). And, there is a limit on how much you can craft at once.

**What you can make with Material Exchange:**

Currently, you will be able to craft:

* Trading Cards (you can pick which one you want to craft, which is a big highlight)
* Daily quest refreshers (if unlocked)
* Stars
* Large sets of Bug Points
* Bundles of Tips (available in 3 or 6 tip packs)
* Guaranteed High-Value Info Guide (this is the treasure map we mentioned, crafting this gets you one treasure map guide)
* Immediate Refund Skip Vouchers - Comes in packs of 2, although rarely, as a special event we may increase it to a 4 voucher value pack (any special events containing the 4 voucher value pack is not confirmed yet). This is a new feature we are adding which lets you skip the refund timer, it’s provided as a Bug Points alternative. It will appear as a payment option when looking at the In A Rush on a newer version confirmation screen.
* Social Vouchers - we will get that soon

Buying materials with Bug Points or Stars will only show in Ways To Get Materials or in Bugs+ In VR if you have less than 55 Materials.

**About the Portable Crafting Table**

A new item as part of the Crafting System, we are adding in the free update is a Portable Crafting Table. It is available from the Bug Point Shop for only 2000 Bug Points. Unlocking it once, will unlock it for the lifetime of the Portable Crafting Table.

The Portable Crafting Table has lots of catches and limits, but it may help you in a quick rush situation, which is part of unleashing the power of Bugs+.

To open it, you can press the C button 3 times to bring up the Portable Crafting Table. On Bugs+ In VR, you can go to the Action Bar and press Portable Crafting Table.

Here is a list of the available features in the Portable Crafting Table:

* **Start Crafting** - Here you can open a mini window where you can start crafting items and select things to craft. But, the catch is that you can only craft Trading Cards that are Common, Uncommon, or Rare, Daily Quest Refreshers, Bug Points bundle of 1000, or Tip Bundles of 3.
* **Rush All Timers** - Here you can Rush Legandary, Ultra Legandary or limited Cards quickly without closing off the menu, or any other item if you don’t care about the window closing or not. Rushing other cards will close off the menu.
* **Upgrade Crafting Limits** - Here you can upgrade your crafting limits remotely. You can only do this for the first two upgrades, then the 3rd upgrade will close off what you are doing and take you to Material Exchange to show a celebration message.
* **Open Material Exchange** - This is your quick portable portal to Material Exchange. No matter where you are, you can open Material Exchange.
* **Call Community Crafting Meeting** - This will remotely call a Community Crafting Meeting from where rather you are in the Unleash HQ. Can only be used in Unleash HQ.
* **Cash In Materials For Community Crafting** - This is the only option available when a Community Crafting session is in progress. This lets you cash in Materials from weather you are on in the Unleash HQ. Can only be used when a Community Crafting session is in progress in an Unleash HQ.

However, after 18 unleashes, the Portable Crafting Table will automatically break and smash itself. This means, you will be prompted to get a new one, and you can’t use it until you go to the Bug Point shop and spend your Bug Points on it. However, 18 uses is a great deal!

### Bugs+ In VR

We are happy to introduce that Bugs+ has now been expanded to VR headsets. When the update releases, to get started with VR, you need to print out the DIY headset and glue and fold it together, or use a Non-DIY Approved Phone Headset. We don’t sell VR headsets for users, but we will provide the template to print out. Bugs+ in VR is not a required feature, but still more than an add on.

**When the update releases, to use VR, you will need:**

Remember, this is DIY not a product we sell, so there are steps you can follow to do it without buying a headset. \
The DIY method is the best way, but see below if you would rather buy one.

Sometimes we may approve non-DIY headsets, we are not sure we will do this, but this means you can buy headsets that are notable on the internet. We are not a partner, maker or affiliates of these headsets, these are just suggestions, we don’t earn moeny from these headsets.

* Access to a printer to print out the template. We will publish the template when the update releases.
* Basic Craft supplies such as something to cut the headset out and glue it with
* A Phone with a Web Browser. It does not matter what phone it is, you just need a phone that has an up to date web browser.
* Something to hold the phone in the VR headset so your phone and the VR headset does not drop. If you don’t have access to this, you can choose to be careful with holding the phone and the VR at the same time.
* A way to hold it. You can either hold it with your hands by making sure both the headset and phone is secured,  or add a strap.
* A space that you will plan to use the VR headset in. make sure the space is safe.
* Signed into A BugID (which is an account for Bugs+)

**How to setup Bugs+ in VR:**

When the update releases, these steps will work. Follow these steps to setup VR:

3. Go to the Account tab on the sidebar (the person icon) and press Bugs+ in VR Settings & Setup
4. Press Setup Bugs+ In VR
5. Confirm that you have made the headset using Yes, I have made the headset, or grab a copy of the headset template by pressing No, how do I make a headset. Rarely, we will approve certain non-DIY headsets from notable non-scam phone headsets on the internet, but we are not sure we will do this, but if you find yourself having one, press Setup A Approved Non-DIY headset on that screen.
6. Your computer will show a link that you will need to enter in your browser. Type that in on a browser of your choice. Make sure to bookmark or remember the page since that is the go-to page for accessing VR.
7. Then, press Next on your computer and you will get a code. Enter that code on your phone on the screen you are on and wait for it to say Press Next On Your Computer. Then, press Next on your computer. It will connect, then press I’ve Connected on your phone.
8. On the screen that says Put Your Phone In Your VR Headset and includes instructions on how, put your phone in the VR headset and attach it to the thing that makes your phone stay in if any. Then, press I’ve done it.
9. Put on your VR headset. Prepare your area, your VR then follow the setup steps. A dot will appear in the middle of the screen. Just move your headset (or head) to move the dot, then make the dot over a button you want to press, and wait for the 2 second mini-sized countdown where the dot is located. Or, connect a Bluetooth controller and press the A button on your controller to confirm the blue dot without the countdown, if configured.
10. Now it is time for Part 2.
11. Your VR is ready for use! Feel free to switch between your computer and VR anytime.

You only need to do this setup once, but you may need to do it again if you Unpair or setup a different phone.

**How will the user experience immersive in VR?**

Here are some of the things that make using Bugs+ In VR immersive.

* **Immersive Collection Experience** - For example, selecting a card will show the card up close to you. Also, refunding cards will feel more immersive.
* **The Final 8 Second Siren Countdown** - In the last 8 seconds of a refund started in Bugs+ In VR, the 8 second siren will fill the virtual environment. It will make the siren noise, show sirens blaring in the environment, and show an action panel. It’s a full screen immersive time sensitive moment.
* **Enhanced Experiences, now in Bugs+ In VR** - Inspired by Hub Mode, some Enhanced Experiences will be added due to the bigger and more immersive area. For example, the questions and choices will appear on the left, and the high quality big bug image will show on the right, no Hub Mode required.
* **Immersive Notifications** - As soon as you get a Real time Notification, it will appear in front of you. Not all notifications will support it to make it less distracting, only notifications relevant now.
* **Do Tasks In Bugs+ In VR** - The game panel will appear in front of you, plus full screen immersive experiences may be available or show up time to time.
* **Your Immersive Environment** - When you are not immersed in full screen experiences on Bugs+ In VR, your Immersive Environment will show up. It is like your home or head quarters for your Bugs+ In VR unleashage sessions. A big panel will appear in front of you, which is the Bugs+ menu, and you can do the things you need to do in Bugs+, and start immersive experiences if you want. Your Immersive Objects will also appear there, which are little items that can help you while not in a full screen experience or give you information.
* **Floating Tips** - The Tips may float sometimes around you, and you can press on it to snap a photo.
* **Immersive Material Exchange** - Opening Material Exchange in Bugs+ In VR will be immersive. There will be a workshop table, and it looks like you are actually crafting. This is a game changer for people who want crafting to be immersive, and want to unleash the power of Bugs+ In VR!
* **Interact with other users and friends in VR** - With our new social features, you can connect with your friends, and meet new users in Bugs+ In VR.
* **Immersive Notifications** - Immersive Notifications will appear right in front of you and are different from the built in notifications that is included in every Bugs+ application. You can turn them off and on from the Action Bar, or from Settings. They are on by default, and you will never miss the time to unleash the power of Bugs+ In VR.
* **And Much More** - We will be adding more along the way, so stay tuned!

**Will All Features Be Available In Bugs+ In VR?**

Not everything, but most things. This is to prevent Bugs+ In VR from crashing.

**How Do I Even Control Bugs+ In VR?**

There are two main ways to control the experience and press buttons.

A dot will appear in the middle of the screen. Just move your headset (or head) to move the dot, then make the dot over a button you want to press, and wait for the 2 second mini-sized countdown where the dot is located. Or, connect a Bluetooth controller and press the A button on your controller to confirm the blue dot without the countdown, if configured.

**How can I change Bugs+ In VR Settings?**

Simply go to the Settings tab on the sidebar (the gear icon) that will appear on VR. There is no Account tab in Bugs+ In VR, instead we replaced it with an exclusive tab.

There is multiple sections in Bugs+ In VR Settings, including:

* **Immersion Level** - Here you can set how immersed you want to be. By default if you don’t change it is More Immersion. You can set it to Less Immersion (things may not be immersive as documented) or More Immersion. Both are very safe anyways, so you are less likely to get hurt.
* **Immersive Notifications** - This lets you set if Immersive Notifications will show up or not. You can set it to Immersive Notifications and Normal Notifications or Normal Notifications Only. Normal notifications are the ones you can see from the Notification bell on the Home tab in the sidebar (the house icon), and the ones that you can see on all your devices, but don’t pop up. This is on by default.
* **Headset Type** - Here you can set if you are using a DIY headset or a Non-DIY Approved Headset. Please be honest, choosing the wrong one may make the experience weird.
* **Homepage Environment** - Here you can set the Immersive Environment, turn on Show Trading Cards Count On Homepage or manage immersive objects.
* **Show Trading Cards Count On Homepage** - This is located in Immersive Environment, so not a seperate area in Settings, but we wanted to show it off anyway. This is the familiar feature where you can show the trading cards count on your homepage if you want. This is off by default.
* **Environment setup** - Switch boundaries and more specially for your VR unleashage space and environment.
* **Unpair** - This unpairs the headset from the BugID and takes you back to the Headset setup screen. This will also reset the Bugs+ In VR settings for the headset.

**How does Bugs+ In VR enforce safety?**

* Bugs+ In VR sets an automatic boundary around you. It will be square shaped, and when you go near it, yo headset will warn you via an Immersive Notification, and it will show regardless of your settings. Going outside of the boundary will show your surroundings via your phone’s back camera, and stop showing any experiences. You will need to recenter the boundary to continue by pressing Recenter. Only Recenter the boundary in a safe place. The boundary can’t be turned off.
* Reminders to Take A Break every 20 minutes. This will show up on your VR experience, and may temporally pause what you are doing and to dismiss it you need to wait 6 seconds. When you do this, you should take a break, and it is recommended. The Take A Break reminders can’t be turned off.
* Users can enable and disable Passthrough Mode from the action menu to check on their surroundings anytime.
* During intense events with lots of movement or risk of falling over, Passthrough may enable automatically for up to 4 seconds. To increase immersion while improving safety, Passthrough activating automatically won’t be in an annoying way. This is a required safety feature.
* VR Safety Tips may appear as a tip while using the Tips Camera. This is an occasional event and does not happen all the time. The safety tip will also be saved to your Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info area just like other tips. If the system chooses a VR Safety tip, the photo will always snap with a gift box.

**How do I unpair Bugs+ In VR?**

1. On the VR, go to the Settings tab on the sidebar (the gear icon)
2. Press Unpair
3. Press Next
4. Press Confirm & Unpair Bugs+ In VR

Note that unpairing will remove mentions of using VR on your computer and unpair it, but it will remove the Bugs+ In Vr settings from the VR headset. You will be able to set it up after or later on, or stop using it if you want.

**Why are suggestions to go on my Bugs+ In VR headset showing on my computer?**

Sometimes we suggest that you should go on your Bugs+ In VR headset will appear, since the expirence may be immersive in VR, and we want you to try it. This is just a reminder for you. To get rid of it, you need to Unpair the headset, but if you have the headset paired, its still a good idea to keep the suggestions since they are not annoying.

**Recenter Your View**

You may need to recenter if

* Parts of the screen aren’t in front of you or you have to turn to see them.
* The dot in the middle is acting a bit odd and it usually does not.
* You can’t find the dot.
* You went outside of the automatic boundary and are asked to go in a safe area and Recenter.
* You can't see the menu or cursor at all.
* You want to re make your boundary.

How to recenter your view:\
To recenter your view, go outside the boundary, then go back in your boundary, and press Recenter. Make sure to do this safely. Or, press the Action Menu bar that appears somewhere on your view. Then a menu will appear with some options. The menu will disappear after a few seconds as well.

Your boundary will also be re-made automatically.

**Quickly change and access common features & settings while immersed in Bugs+ In VR**

You may want to change settings, but you may also be immersed on in something time sensitive, but you can use this anytime. To quickly change and access things, press the Action Menu bar that appears somewhere on your view. Then a menu will appear with some options. The menu will disappear after a few seconds as well.

You can change these without going anywhere else:

* **Recenter View** - Recenter your view quickly without going outside of the boundary.
* **Immersion Level** - Quickly Change your Immersion level to either Less Immersion or More Immersion without leaving the menu.
* **Immersive Notifications** - Quickly turn on or off Immersive Notifications, like if you are ready to get them or don’t want to be distracted.
* **Passthrough Mode** - This turn in your phone’s back camera to your surroundings in the background VR environment, and if Passthrough Mode is on already, it will turn it off. While using this mode, the boundary will get bigger since you can see your surroundings.
* **Portable Crafting Table** - This lets you use the functions of the Portable Crafting Table item. Only shows if you have the item in your inventory.
* **Respawn** - Appearing on only Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms, this lets you respawn back to the main area, the Menu, without leaving. Only appears in Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms.
* **Respawn & Leave** - This Leaves the Unleash HQ or Unleash Room and respawns back to the Menu. Only appears in Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms.

* **Open Settings** - Open the Settings tab for more control. Note that this will get out of whatever you are doing, and takes you to the Settings tab.

**Will there be more features getting added to Bugs+ In VR?**

Yes, we are planning to add more features.

**Immersive Environments & Homepage Environment**

<details>

<summary>Change your Homepage Environment</summary>

When you are not immersed in any full screen immersive experience, your Immersive Environment will show up. A Immersive Environment is a dedicated virtual space for use when there is no full screen immersive experience. It is like a background on a device, but immersive and 3D. The menu will also appear right in front of you. This won’t show if Passthrough is enabled, since when enabled, Passthrough uses your device back camera to make the environment or show your surroundings.

For example, there could be an outdoors area with lots of bugs. This feature is to make it feel like you are in a world you actually like and make it feel like you are still in Bugs+.

**What environments are there?**

You can choose from:

* **Flapping Butterflies** - This will show lots of butterflies flapping around. (default)
* **Creepy Spiders** - This will show spiders with spider webs. Note that this may be scary for some users.
* **Praying Mantises** - This will show praying mantises catching annoying flies and eating them in the background. The annoying flies won’t go near you, they are just a background element.

You can also change the environment to make it look better.

**To do this, follow these steps:**

1. On your Bugs+ In VR, go to the Settings tab in the sidebar (the gear icon), or use the Action Bar and select Settings.
2. Press Homepage Environment
3. Select from Flapping Butterflies, Creepy Spiders or Praying Mantises.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Show the number of trading cards on your Homepage in Bugs+ In VR</summary>

You can show the amount of trading cards you have on the Home tab on the sidebar in Bugs+ In VR. This is off by default, but you can turn it back on or off again.

**To do this, follow these steps:**

1. On your Bugs+ In VR, go to the Settings tab in the sidebar (the gear icon), or use the Action Bar and select Settings.
2. Press Homepage Environment
3. Select Show Trading Cards Count On Homepage

There are many other settings we may of not documented, check them out and unleash the power of them! We may also share some more settings in this area later on in this post as well.

</details>

**Immersive Objects in your Immersive Environment**

On your Immersive Environment, there may be objects other than the Bugs+ Menu. These are called Immersive Objects. They may be able to let you take action quickly, or give you helpful information. These are inspired by Hub Mode widgets. You can also check these while immersed as well.

<details>

<summary>What Immersive Objects can I add?</summary>

You can currently add these objects to your Immersive Environment:

* **Bug Points, Stars & Levels & XP count** - Quickly check on your resources to plan what you will do next, without digging through menus. (yes, it’s a combined widget, but it may not have other things like Refund Credits and Materials)
* **Daily Quests Status** - Quickly check if there are new quests, or if you have completed some and need to claim the rewards. Inspired by the Hub Mode widget. It also includes an Action Button to go to the Daily Quests area and  claim rewards (it will do if for you as soon as you press the button) or go to the Daily Quests area to see your quests list.
* **Immersive Material Exchange Portal** - This features a large Action Button, that when used, will quickly teleport you to the Material Exchange workshop. The portal also shows reminders when the workshop needs attention, like since an item has finished crafting since you last went in the workshop recently.
* **Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info Reminders** - This object cycles through your Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info Reminders and shows it on the object for easy looking. The tip on the object changes every once in a while while you play, and shows three tips at once. It also features an Action Button to quickly go to the Unlocked Tips, Tricks & Info menu.
* **Quiz Of The Day** - Shows the Quiz Of The Day on the object, which is the quiz of the day that appears on all your Bugs+ Applications, like in the main Bugs+ application. This is a perfect object to use and unleash the power of since Quiz Of The Day quizzes give you double points, and more Stars opportunities. It also features an Action Button to quickly start the current Quiz Of The Day.
* **Refund Heads-Up** - This object shows any pending refund timers if any. It also includes an Action Button to go to the Cards To Be Refunded. When idle, it tells you that a refund may be waiting for you.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Check Immersive Objects quickly when immersed</summary>

As well as Immersive Objects showing up on your Immersive Environment, you can use and check Immersive Objects while in a full screen experience. You can do this by opening the Action Bar, and the Immersive Objects will appear on the left and right of the action menu that appears.

If you would rather only have your actions in the action menu, you can turn this setting off by following these steps:

1. On your Bugs+ In VR, go to the Settings tab in the sidebar (the gear icon), or use the Action Bar and select Settings.
2. Press Homepage Environment
3. Press Manage Immersive Objects
4. Tap Where Immersive Objects Can Be Found
5. Turn off Show Immersive Objects In Action Menu (you can also turn it back on)

Note that some Immersive Objects may close off what you are currently doing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>About Action Buttons on Immersive Objects</summary>

Immersive Objects can have buttons on them, which is called Action Buttons. They let you quickly take action, or open menus. An example of a notable Action Button is for the **Daily Quests Status** object, where you can quickly claim rewards and open your quests list.

To interact with an Action Button, look at it for 2 seconds or click on it with your controller.

</details>

* Manage the immersive objects, add them, remove them, rearrange them and more.

</details>

Immersive Objects will always show in the following positions, so it’s a good idea to unleash the power of this knowledge.

1. **The first object on the list you chose** - The first widget arranged on the list, will always appear on a bit on the left of the Bugs+ Menu in the Immersive Environment.
2. **The second object on the list you chose** - The second widget arranged on the list, will always appear on a bit on the right of the Bugs+ Menu in the Immersive Environment.
3. **The third object on the list you chose** - The third widget arranged on the list, will always appear on more of the left of the first object.
4. **The fourth object on the list you chose** - The fourth widget arranged on the list, will always appear on more of the right of the second object.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Manage when Immersive Objects appear on the Immersive Environment</summary>

You can choose when you want Immersive Objects to even show in your Immersive Environment, which could help control object clutter.

**You can choose from:**

* **Appear all the time when in the Immersive Environment** - This will show your Immersive Objects as soon as you open your Immersive Environment, and hide the widgets when you are not in your Immersive Environment. This is the default setting.
* **Show the first object added, and show more when the Immersive Objects menu is opened** - This will show the first object added to the list in your Immersive Environment all the time, and to show more, you can look at the Show Immersive Objects button that will appear in the environment for 2 seconds or select it with your controller. Immersive Objects will show for 12 seconds in this mode then minimise again after.
* **Require Immersive Objects menu to be open to show widgets** - This will hide all widgets on your Immersive Environment initially. To temporarily show widgets, you can look at the Show Immersive Objects button that will appear in the environment for 2 seconds or select it with your controller. Immersive Objects will show for 21 seconds in this mode then minimise again after.

**To change this, follow these steps:**

1. On your Bugs+ In VR, go to the Settings tab in the sidebar (the gear icon), or use the Action Bar and select Settings.
2. Press Homepage Environment
3. Press Manage Immersive Objects
4. Tap Where Immersive Objects Can Be Found
5. Select when Immersive Objects should show in the environment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What Objects are added by default?</summary>

The **Bug Points, Stars, Levels & XP Object** is added by default, but you can change it, add more Objects, or remove it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>About suggestions for adding new Objects</summary>

Sometimes when you use a feature in Bugs+ In VR, the game may suggest thst the widget associated with that should be added. When that happens, you will get a small popup, with the options to Add Object, or Ignore. The suggestion will only appear up to 3 times per Object type. After Ignoring it once, Bugs+ In VR will suggest it later on until you keep Ignoring it. After Ignoring it twice, Bugs+ In VR will suggest it in a couple of weeks or months when relevant.

You can also turn off these suggestions if they are annoying, by following these steps:

1. On your Bugs+ In VR, go to the Settings tab in the sidebar (the gear icon), or use the Action Bar and select Settings.
2. Press Homepage Environment
3. Press Manage Immersive Objects
4. Tap Suggestions for new Immersive Objects
5. Select if and when Suggestions should appear. You can select from:

* **Show suggestions when necessary** - This will show suggestions when it’s recommended that you should add a specific widget. This is the default.
* **Show suggestions, but stop showing after ignoring once** - This will show suggestions when needed, but ignoring it once will stop showing that specific suggestion altogether.
* **Suggestions disabled** - This will not show the Immersive Objects suggestions at all.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many objects can I add at once?</summary>

You can add up to **4 objects** at once. There is no such thing as unlocking a fifth object at once in Bugs+ In VR.

Make sure to use space wisely and avoid clutter. For users new to Bugs+ In VR, we recommend starting off with **one widget**, this is not enforced, but recommended. For users that have got the hang of Bugs+ In VR but are not advanced yet, we recommend having **two or three widgets**. For advanced users in Bugs+ In VR, we recommend having **three or four widgets**. It’s up to you, but these are just recommendations.

</details>

**The Bugs+ Menu, In Bugs+ In VR**

When you are in your Immersive Environment (or if you are in your Passthrough mode when there is no full screen experience), a menu will appear as well. It is like your Bugs+ gameplay projected. This appears when there is no immersive things to show on the menu area.

But, the menu is a bit different. You should learn about the Navigator. The Navigator is the menu for Bugs+, where you will do your normal gameplay and launch immersive things with a menu.

On the left side of the Menu, is the sidebar. These are your normal buttons you can press. At the bottom of the Menu, is the activity you are doing and you can switch between it. You can select the gaming icon for the normal Bugs+ Menu, or switch to the social side of things with the person icon. The social activity is basically the Community tab, enhanced. We are planning to migrate the normal Community tab on the VR to a more immersive area to launch social features.

**About the Social Area on the Navigator**

We will get into that soon.

**Fix Errors on Bugs+ In VR**

<details>

<summary>What to do first</summary>

Before taking any other actions, restart your phone for an easy fix.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What to do if it continues to glitch</summary>

Try unpairing and reparing. If that does not help, contact Bugs+ Support.

</details>

### Social Features

This is a game changer for interaction! For the first time in Bugs+, we are introducing features to help you connect with friends and new non-scam people. To do this, we are introducing a set of interaction and social features in Bugs+ that you can access as soon as November 19 hits and you update. It will be available on the desktop version, with an immersive (and very immersive as well) version available on Bugs+ In VR.

**What social features are you adding?**

We are introducing the following social features:

* The 3 Meet Up Areas
  * **Unleash HQ** - In Unleash HQ, you can interact with other users, in a dedicated Hub Space. Each Unleash HQ can hold up to 9 users. It is a pretty wide space, and for the first time, there are arrows that you can look at for 2 seconds to move.
  * **Unleash Rooms** - You can invite up to 2 to 4 other friends from your Friends List to a Unleash Room. You can interact with them, and you can even look at information together, do quizzes together, talk to each other using chat (we promise that we have strict chat rules with no swearing and no abuse), and even watch someone else do a task or gather around a Immersive Material Exchange.
  * **Unleash Worlds** - Unleash Worlds are public, time limited, and user created meet up areas. This is similar to Unleash Worlds, but users can customize it a lot.
* More Useful Social Features
  * **Friends List** - You can Friend your friends, and people that you liked meeting up with and want to interact with more, and invite them to Unleash HQ, Unleash Rooms, and more.
  * **Bugs+ Scrolling Feed** - When you craft something, finish a quite big refund, level up at to a notable milestone, get limited time cards or do something pretty big, your friends can scroll through their **Bugs+ Scrolling Feed** to see your and other friend’s progress, and send you encouragement notifications, and the other way around as well.
  * **Shared Tasks & Gameplay** - When starting a craft, refund, get a Gift Box or want to team up in a limited time event, you can split up the rewards between you and friends (sharing is caring, and is now the shared unleashage key) and give your friends updates on it. You can do this through the “Share Rewards” feature if you have friends on your Friends List. You can add up to 2 other friends (so that means you can have up to 3 users getting the rewards at once including you).

**How can I access the Unleash HQ?**

You can access the Unleash HQ, a place to meet up with public users, by using a menu item. Here are the instructions based on what device you are using.

If you are using a Computer, follow these steps:

1. On the Home tab on the sidebar (the house icon) press Unleash HQ & Rooms, or go to the Community tab on the sidebar (the cell phone tower icon)
2. If you used the Home tab shortcut, press Open Unleash HQ, and if you used the Community Tab, press Unleash HQ

If you are using Bugs+ In VR, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Home tab on the sidebar (the house icon), which is opened by default if no other menu items are actively being used when you go to the Immersive Environment
2. Press the Social Features & Bugs+ HQ floating bar that appears under the menu
3. Press Open Bugs+ HQ on the options that appears

**What can I do in the Unleash HQ?**

You can meet up with all sorts of players, and friends if any. You will be able to move around, and access certain areas. In the main area, where your screen is, other people can’t see, but there is an area where everyone can gather around some community selected widgets.

Even while on desktop, the desktop version still lets you move around on a 2D interface, but some features may not work on desktop only.

**Does anyone own an Unleash HQ and if I own one how do I use the tools?**

The first person to join is the Admin of the Unleash HQ. They get to choose what environment the VR version is in, like Flapping Butterflies, or Praying Mantises. They can’t choose Creepy Spiders just in case someone gets scared. They also get to choose the Theme of the Desktop version and the VR version, they can choose from Blue (default), Red, Yellow and Green. They can‘t kick or ban users, to prevent people from being rude. You will be asked when you are the first to join to choose a theme and environment.

If you are an Admin, follow these steps to use your Tools:

1. Go to the area that shows your personal Menu or Respawn via the Action Bar. This step is not required on Desktop.
2. Press the Customise button, or if you are on Desktop, press Change Theme.
3. Select an Environment and Theme.

**How do I move around?**

In Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms, you can move around in different ways, based on what platform you are using.

If you are using Bugs+ In VR:

Look down for the arrows, and look at the direction arrow you want to move in. You won’t move in a tiny amount, it will be more steps every click, to make up for the 2 second wait. This also makes it easier.

How to move on Desktop:

Simply use your arrow keys to move.

**What can I do in the Unleash HQ?**

You can do the following things:

* Meet new people
* Interact with Friends
* See the community picked Immersive Objects. These change and include relevant data, and if it is a Bug Points, Stars, Levels & XP object, it will show combined data. On Desktop, you can see the objects in 2D but they won’t look immersive.
* Use the Bugs+ Menu while interacting with friends
* And more, we are planning to add a lot

**Community Picked Immersive Objects**

Now and then, Immersive Objects will change time to time in Unleash HQ. They will feature combined totals of user’s points, tips, Quiz Of The Day, and other things. You can still see the widgets in 2D on Desktop, but it may not be immersive, and Action Buttons won‘t work until you use Bugs+ In VR.

**Customise your Avatar**

Your Avatar is your virtual face and body that will be shown to others and friends when you are in Unleash HQ or Unleash Rooms. You can change it how you like it as well.

When another player high fives the other player, the high five will hold in after doing it. You can stop holding the high five by pressing Done. Holding the high five for 2 seconds will send a Friend Request to the other user, and it being automaticity accepted. This adds more fun to the High Five system.
* **Love Heart** - This shows a Love Heart next to the user who did the Emote.
* **Smile** - This shows a smile face next to the user who did the emote.
* **Unleash It!** - This emote shows a dog and a bug getting unleashed. Useful for when talking about unleashing the power of Bugs+.

**When do Emotes automatically get used?**

Sometimes, Emotes may be automatically used to celebrate certain things. Here is a list of when this happens:

* **Running Away** - When a player uses Respawn & Leave, or the leave function in general, shows the user saying Bye Bye, see you later, then they will run, then they will leave.
* **Celebration Clapping** - When someone accepts a friend request, and the person who sent it is in the same Unleash HQ or Unleash Rooms, or uses High Five and it involves a friend request being accepted, both the users will start clapping for a bit, and a big banner saying that they became friends together will fly up, then disappear after a few seconds.
* **Confetti** - This happens when someone finishes a big high value personal craft or refund, eligible for the Scrolling Feed or Worlds Replay, or when any Community Crafting is completed. Confetti will rain down from the sky for a bit, and a gigantic banner will show up showing info about the achievement. Unlike other Emotes, this Emote stays active for 12 seconds, plus gives everyone an Immersive Notification on Bugs+ In VR, or popup on Desktop.

**Can I use menus while in Unleash HQ or Unleash Rooms?**

Yes you can. Just go to the Bugs+ Menu are in the Main Area in Bugs+ In VR and do what you need to do, or on desktop, press the Menu icon, then press Respawn & Multitask. This will respawn you if you are not near where normally the big menu is, but you can multitask and switch screens without leaving.

**About the Community Crafting Table in the Unleash HQ**

The Community Crafting Table is a place users can gather around to craft something as a team effort. Players can cash in Materials to rush the timer and add materials toward the crafting. \
Every user in that Unleash HQ will get the item if it crafts, for the price of one item.&#x20;

To get started, a user will need to call a Community Crafting Meeting. Users will be able to vote on a material to craft, and cash in Materials if they want.

There can be 1 item crafting at a time in the Community Crafting, but users can cash in extra materials to temporarily add more upgrades to the community crafting for the length of that Unleash HQ instance.&#x20;

After a Community Craft starts, it can’t be cancelled. Users can‘t do their own crafting if a Community Crafting session is in progress and they are in the same instance of Unleash HQ. In Community Crafting, crafts last much shorter than the time mentioned, and waiting more than 20 minutes is not a thing in Community Crafting.&#x20;

There must be 2 or more players in that Unleash HQ to start it, and it will be automatically cancelled if 2 or more users don’t vote on the crafting.

**How can I call a Community Crafting Meeting in the Unleash HQ?**

Follow these steps to call a Community Crafting Meeting:

1. To start a Community Crafting Meeting, on Bugs+ In VR, go to the crafting table near the Main area. Or, On Desktop, move to the Crafting Table area.

Everyone will be notified with an Immersive Notification if they are on Bugs+ In VR, or if they are on Desktop, they will be notified with a popup notification. Users can take action on the notification by moving to the Crafting Table. If they are far away from it, they will have an option to teleport near the crafting table.

**How do I vote on a Community Crafting Meeting?**

In Community Crafting Meetings, you can vote on what to craft and chat with each other to decide. Meetings will last for up to 2 minutes. After everyone votes or the time ticks down, the most voted item will be picked. 2 or more players needs to decide on something. If there are not 2 or more votes by the end, the craft will be cancelled.

After the meeting, users will need to cash in materials to fund the item that is being crafted. Users will be prompted to, and if there is not enough, users can go back to the Crafting Table to cash in more materials.

**Why would users need to cash in Materials for Community Crafting Meetings?**

Users will have the ability to give Materials to the Crafting Table. This helps fund for the materials required to do the Community Crafting. After the voting and if a thing to craft has been decide, users can start cashing in Materials. After the prompt, users can go back to the Crafting Table if they want to cash in extra materials if some is needed. You will get reminders if more Materials are needed or recommended.

Any left over materials will be used for any other crafts or rushing timers in that specific Unleash HQ instance.

**How can I rush a Community Crafting Session with Materials?**

Rushing on Unleash HQ will cost 10 Materials because of the extra users. To Rush a timer, you can cash in extra Materials to fund the timer rushing. You can only start funding the timer rushing after there is enough materials cashed in and the item starts crafting.

**Do I really need Bugs+ In VR for these social features?**

No, you don’t! You can use a Desktop, but since some of the social features are optimized for Bugs+ In VR, some features may be in different areas, may be 2D or may not work. We recommend using Bugs+ In VR when available, but you can still use a Desktop.

**About Social Vouchers**

Social Vouchers are a craftable item that lets you do lots of extra things (once off per voucher) on Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms - and it is cheap to. When a voucher is used the actions associated with will be done and that specific voucher will be gone, but you can get more or use other ones you have.

Social Vouchers can:

* **Rush Community Crafting Sessions** - As an alternative for rushing timers in Community Crafting Sessions, you can also use 1 Social Voucher to rush 1 whole timer. It is like reserving specific materials for Social Features only. You also save 3 materials, so it is also a value pack.
* **Expand The Size Of Unleash Rooms** - You can use a Social Voucher to allow up to 7 players instead of 4 once.
* **Expand the size of the Unleash HQ** - When the space is filling up (there is 7 or more players) you can use a Social Voucher to temporarily expand the maximum players of the Unleash HQ you are in to 18 players instead of 9. As well as that, the system will temporarily prefer to let new players join the one you are in.
* **Give a boost to everyone in the same Unleash HQ as you** - If you are feeling nice, you can cash in one of your Social Vouchers to give everyone a Gift Box with 1000 Bug Points, 10 stars, 25 materials, a Rare trading card and a Tip. And, it does not drain your resources instead it uses the Social Voucher you cashed in as payment. The game will remind you every 7 minutes if you want to send a boost (reminders will only send if you have a Social Voucher)

To use them, when an opportunity hits time, you will be prompted.

**About the Personal Bubble in Social Features on Bugs+ In VR**

If someone is touching each other or too close to eachother in Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms, they will fade out a bit on both the user’s screens (not everyone’s) on Bugs+ In VR, until they move further away. This is to ensure safety.

**About Personal Galleries in Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms**

Each user in Bugs+ who uses the social features gets a Personal Gallery. The Gallery is a free item that you can use to show off your collection in the Unleash HQ and Unleash Rooms.

Galleries will be randomly cycled through and displayed as a Immersive Object. 2 Galleries can be displayed at once. The Galleries displayed there will randomly change from time to time.

In Unleash Rooms, the person who created the Gallery can choose users to display their galleries in a dedicated area.

Click on a Gallery to see the trading cards inside it. You can display up to 7 cards here. To change it, go to the Community tab on the sidebar (the cell phone tower icon) and click Displayed Trading Cards.

**What are Duels?**

In some cases, users can see your trading card collection if displayed in Personal Gallery. If someone finds a trading card in your Gallery that catches your eye, they can Duel it. They will choose some points to use as an offer. They can offer you Bug Points in bundles of 500 points, they can choose how many bundles to offer. If you accept the Duel, the displayed trading card will be removed from your Gallery and given to the person who offered the points, but you will get the Bug Points.

**About the Joinable status**

Friends on your Friends List can join the Unleash HQ or Unleash Rooms you are in. You can change this in your Settings. You can choose from Joinable (your friends can join you plus they will see you are online and what social feature you are using), Online Status Only (they can see you are online, but cant join you without an invite, and they can only see if you are interacting with a social feature if online), or No Status (your friend will see Active Status Hidden).

**About the Portable Crafting Table**

Even though this may not seem related, but it is. You can use it to boost community crafts plus your personal crafts, even while in Unleash HQ and rooms.

A new item as part of the Crafting System, we are adding in the free update is a Portable Crafting Table. It is available from the Bug Point Shop for only 2000 Bug Points. Unlocking it once, will unlock it for the lifetime of the Portable Crafting Table.

The Portable Crafting Table has lots of catches and limits, but it may help you in a quick rush situation, which is part of unleashing the power of Bugs+.

To open it, you can press the C button 3 times to bring up the Portable Crafting Table. On Bugs+ In VR, you can go to the Action Bar and press Portable Crafting Table.

Here is a list of the available features in the Portable Crafting Table:

* **Start Crafting** - Here you can open a mini window where you can start crafting items and select things to craft. But, the catch is that you can only craft Trading Cards that are Common, Uncommon, or Rare, Daily Quest Refreshers, Bug Points bundle of 1000, or Tip Bundles of 3.
* **Rush All Timers** - Here you can Rush Legandary, Ultra Legandary or limited Cards quickly without closing off the menu, or any other item if you don’t care about the window closing or not. Rushing other cards will close off the menu.
* **Upgrade Crafting Limits** - Here you can upgrade your crafting limits remotely. You can only do this for the first two upgrades, then the 3rd upgrade will close off what you are doing and take you to Material Exchange to show a celebration message.
* **Open Material Exchange** - This is your quick portable portal to Material Exchange. No matter where you are, you can open Material Exchange.
* **Call Community Crafting Meeting** - This will remotely call a Community Crafting Meeting from where rather you are in the Unleash HQ. Can only be used in Unleash HQ.
* **Cash In Materials For Community Crafting** - This is the only option available when a Community Crafting session is in progress. This lets you cash in Materials from weather you are on in the Unleash HQ. Can only be used when a Community Crafting session is in progress in an Unleash HQ.

However, after 18 unleashes, the Portable Crafting Table will automatically break and smash itself. This means, you will be prompted to get a new one, and you can’t use it until you go to the Bug Point shop and spend your Bug Points on it. However, 18 uses is a great deal!

### Action Button
