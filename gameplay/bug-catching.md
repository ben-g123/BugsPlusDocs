# Bug Catching Game

In the Bug Catching Game area in one of the buttons in the More Tab (the 3 dots icon), you will learn about where bugs live, how to not get bitten or stung by insects and more.

You can find it by going to the More Tab (the 3 dots icon) and pressing Bug Catching Game then Start.

You will have 7 in-game days (not real days) where each day is around 2 minutes to collect as many bugs as possible.

If you loose all your HP, usually by not being careful and getting bitten or stung a lot, you will have the restart the in-game day or end the in-game day.
