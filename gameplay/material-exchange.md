# Material Exchange

In Bugs+, you can exchange some “game materials” to get items, for example, they can help you in Quizzes by giving you hints, customise your profile and more.

There is a Material Exchange button on the Collection tab once it is first unlocked. It can be unlocked after you reach level 18, which gives you the **second shop upgrade**. You can exchange materials in the Material Exchange tab in the shop.

You can also trade materials in the Trading tab, but both players will need to unlock Material Exchange first.

You can get more materials after or during quests, quizzes and other Bugs+ activities, and you can also get some from the “materials area” in the Shop.
