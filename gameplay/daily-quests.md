# Daily Quests

Every day, there is different Daily Quests available to do. When you are ready to do them for that day, go to the Daily Quests tab for the daily quests to generate them. (it will only automatically generate once per day). You can do them, and you will get the reward provided.

## Special Daily Quests

On days like April Fools, a special daily quest will be avaible. Make sure to go to the tab on that day to generate them and then do the tasks. You may even get 20 stars!

## Refreshing The Daily Quests Multiple Times A Day

If you want to refresh the daily quests more than one time ina day, for example if you want to skip that set of quests and get a new one, or if you want to get another set of quests since you already did the one for today, that is possible.

You can use a **Daily Quests Refresher** item to get a new set of quests to do. You will unlock this item at level 35, and you will also get one of them as a gift at that level as well, and at level 40, 45, 50, and 55 you will get them as a gift additionally, and at events you may be able to get them. You can get them anytime at the Bug Points shop.

You can use that item via a button at the Daily Quests tab.

The button looks like this:
