# Gift Boxes

You can get Gift Boxes by progressing though the game, sometimes from quests, sometimes from Special Events, sometimes from Giveaways and more.

It also helps people learn since they will use the items or look at the Trading Cards and learn about insects.

The Gift Box can contain almost any item. It has multiple items in the Gift Box. It may contain a trading card, Trade Ad voucher, a material for use in Material Exchange and more. You never know what you might get!
