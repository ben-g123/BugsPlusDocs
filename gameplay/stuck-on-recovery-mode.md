# Stuck on Recovery Mode

On older versions of Bugs+, there may be a Recovery Mode screen if Bugs+ fails to connect to more than a certain amount of Bugs+ Servers. Try again, bypass the error, debug or/and Contact Bugs+ Support to fix. You can also Erase Data (or Rebirth, if you have an older version), see [reset-data.md](reset-data.md "mention").
