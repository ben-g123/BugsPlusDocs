# Notifications

As you learn about insects using Bugs+, you may get notifications, for things that are not limited to trade requests, level ups, friend requests, special events, daily quest updates, quiz completions and more.

You can find them by going to the Home tab (the house icon) and presssing the bell in the top of the screen on the Home tab. The notification bell will change colors based off how many notifications there are. You will also get a reminder on the Home tab (the house icon) when you have more than 9 notifications.

You can also clear your notifications by pressing the Clear button on the notifications screen then confirm the action. This is so you can make your notifications screen clean and so your notifications don’t hit the notification limit.

## Notification Limit

There is also a Notification Limit in Bugs+. When you hit that limit, new notifications won’t show until you clear your notifications or upgrade your notifications. Notifications from Bugs+ Admins don‘t count towards the limit. The first limit before you upgrade it is 15 notifications maximum at a time.

You can upgrade the limit by going to the More tab (the 3 dots icon) then press Bug Point Shop then press the right arrow at the bottom of the screen. Then press Upgrade Notification Limit. Then you can see the upgrades and how many Bug Points it costs.
