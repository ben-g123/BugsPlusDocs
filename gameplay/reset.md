# Erase Bugs+ Data

If you want to start all over from the beginning of Bugs+ but want to keep your friends, username and login, your data is corrupted and support can't help (sometimes support can help with that), or to clear cheated or hacked data, you can reset most of your data.

Parental Controls data will still be kept, and some social data such as friends lists will be kept, and trading histories will be kept as well (for investigation and data purposes). You can still keep your username.

* You will <mark style="color:red;">**loose most of your Bugs+ Data**</mark>, including your Points, Stars and more, plus your notifications will be cleared, and all local Bugs+ data on the device that was used to reset the BugID will be removed
* It is possible to recover data after resetting, but it is very rare and unlikely, and support will try very hard for famous users on Bugs+.
* If you are resetting in a public or crowded area, please turn down the volume or mute it temporarily to avoid annoying everyone with a loud siren.
