# Erase Bugs+ Data

If you want to start from the begining of Bugs+, your data is corrupted and support can't help (sometimes support can help with that), or to clear cheated or hacked data, you can reset most of your data.

Parental Controls data will still be kept, and some social data such as friends lists will be kept, and trading histories will be kept as well (for investigation purposes).

**Follow these steps to reset Bugs+:**

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon)
2. Press Settings
3. Press More Settings
4. Press Erase Data like shown on the image on the right:      ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 1.00.16 pm.png>)
5. Press Restart, a Bugs+ re-opening will be automatically done (Quick Restart) after pressing the button, which helps cancel any unneeded temporary data processes:    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 12.59.32 pm.png>)
6. Press Next after Bugs+ quickly re-opens:      ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Image 10-9-2025 at 1.16 pm.png>)
7. Press Reset:     ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 1.02.20 pm.png>)
