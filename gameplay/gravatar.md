# Gravatar Integration

Since the release of Bugs+, you can link your Gravatar Bio to your profile and get extra features for your profile, like a opportunity for people looking at your profile to learn more about you at your Gravatar page, filling out fields on the profile like display name, and getting an “avatar” to use in Bugs+. (which is not possible in the UI without Gravatar)

It also will sync to other services that integrate Gravatar like Wordpress.com.

## Setting up your Gravatar page

Before you can start to link your bio, you need a page to link it to first. The good thing about this is that it is easy to do and it is FREE. You can Claim Your Gravatar Page by using the button below or by going to https://gravatar.com/connect

There is also a direct link in the linking screen after pressing Don’t Have A Bio? in the Gravatar connection settings.

<a href="https://gravatar.com/connect" class="button primary">Claim Gravatar Page</a>\


## Linking your Gravatar page to Bugs+

You can link your Gravatar account in Account Settings by following the instructions below:

1. Press the Account button in Bugs+
2. Press Settings
3. Press Account Settings
4. Press User Details
5. Press Gravatar connection settings
6. Type in your Gravatar Bio link. You can find this in your Gravatar control panel. If you have a custom domain (most people don’t, but this is a link that does not start with gravatar.com and is either paid for or received for free), please use another method by clicking More Methods…
7. If that does not work, please try again or press More Methods… and use another method. Methods other than entering the link includes entering your email linked with a Gravatar Bio, logging in with your Gravatar account, entering your name that is used on one of your Verified Accounts and directly entering your username.

### About Gravatar setup recommendations

When you setup your account for the first time, or when you sign in on a new device with an incomplete profile, you may get a Gravatar setup recommendation. This will be sent out via Notifications, a reminder on the Homepage, a banner on your profile, and a notice when you edit your profile details using the normal method.

They will only appear when you have an incomplete profile, and will stop showing when you dismiss them, don’t interact them for quite a bit, or setup Gravatar. They won’t reappear after all the triggers run out, even if you unlink Gravatar.

You can click on the recommendation on your homepage or profile to get easy access to the setup process, and get more info about Gravatar.

If we detect that you already use Gravatar when you sign up for Bugs+, you can easily link your page in one click after reviewing the details, or use a different bio link. You will also get different content in the notice, and the notice is changed to: “It looks like you have a Gravatar profile already, do you want to link it with Bugs+, create a new one or use a different one?“

* Have a BugID and is currently signed into it. Gravatar support is not available on Guest Mode.
* Gravatar must be supported on the device you setup your bio information.

* Wordpress must be available in your country.

Also, other features may require different conditions as well. They are listed below:

* Have the email inbox associated with your Gravatar profile ready, and not be locked out of your account. This requires you to authenticate your Gravatar account to Bugs+ (in a secure way).

## Unlinking Gravatar

If you no longer need the special features of our Gravatar integration and feel like you want to unlink it, this is possible. Follow the following instructions:

1. Press the Account button in Bugs+
2. Press Settings
3. Press Account Settings
4. Press Gravatar connection settings

{% hint style="info" %}
This won’t disable or delete your Gravatar account. You also can’t do this directly inside Bugs+ (but there is still a link to to the disable page), so you will need to do it at [https://gravatar.com/profile?modal=disable-account\&from-modal=account-settings](https://gravatar.com/profile?modal=disable-account\&from-modal=account-settings) then press Disable.
{% endhint %}

## Troubleshooting Gravatar connection issues

If you find a error while using Bugs+ related to Gravatar, while editing Gravatar settings or using a Gravatar feature, you can find out how to troubleshoot it below. You should also try pressing the Re-Do button as well.

### Profile does not exist (404)

If you get an error saying your profile does not exist, try refreshing the app or pressing Re-Do.

If you still get this message, here are some ways to fix it.

* Have you changed your Gravatar username lately before linking to Bugs+? This can affect this. Try relinking Gravatar by pressing Unlink then Confirm. Then go to the settings page again and re link it.
* Review the Gravatar username shown in the error. Does it match the one you see on your Gravatar account? If it does not, try relinking your account. Press Unlink then confirm, then go to the settings page then re link it.
* If you still get this error, try using another method while relinking.
* Did you delete your Wordpress.com account that is used with your linked Gravatar? Try recovering your Wordpress data or starting fresh from a new Gravatar and Wordpress account.
* Still get this error? Go to bugsplus.me/support to try to get help from either Bugs+ or/and the Community.

### Gravatar Account Disabled or no longer active

This error means that you or someone else tried to delete your data on your Gravatar account. There is a quick fix, and do it ASAP since your Gravatar could get permanently deleted soon If no action is taken.

1. Go to Gravatar.com
2. Click your icon
3. Click Enable Gravatar

If you can’t do this, try submitting a ban appeal to the Gravatar support team since your Gravatar account may of been banned for some reason.

### 429 too many requests

This means you did too many Gravatar actions, or the Gravatar active user base is very active right now. Try again soon or later, and don’t send more requests or it may make the wait time longer

### 403

This may mean that you, Bugs+ or someone has been banned from Gravatar recently, but that’s not only the case.

If it looks like a glitch in the software, you should also go to bugsplus.me/support and report it on the forum, and do one of these: email Bugs+ support or start a live chat with Support.

## Why we added this

It is a good way for people to learn more about each other, and it encourages people to make a personal bio about themselves. It also makes quicker profile setup in Bugs+ and in other services like Wordpress.

### Going Forward

We are planning to add more features to support this idea, like a Lobbies feature to share your Gravatar avatar and bio, and automatically autofilling account details (which can be undone in a tap, or expanded on with the Gravatar integration in a few taps). We will announce this more later, but stsy tuned!
