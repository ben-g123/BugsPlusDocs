# Collection

When you collect Trading Cards from Daily Quests, the Bug Point Shop and more, you can find your Trading Cards in the Collection. You can find your Collection by pressing the SD card / trading card icon on the sidebar, which will take you to the Collection tab. You will also be able to see how many Trading cards you have there. There you can use the arrows to move between pages, and press the trading card to see it in bigger view, so you can see the insect facts on it. You can also ask AI about the card, if ”Explain With BugAI” is enabled in Settings. You can also configure the Home tab (the house icon) to tell you how many trading cards you have even when you are not at the Collection tab by going to the Account Tab (the person icon), pressing Settings, pressing Homepage and selecting Show Trading Cards Count on Homepage.

Alongside finding it manually, you can also enter a exact trading card name in the box to jump straight to it, which includes the exact capitalisation. You can do this using the Search icon on the Collection tab.

You can also see the Trading Card’s rarity. This is how rare it is to get.

## Possible rarities:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Ultra Rare
* Legendary
* Ultra Legendary
* Limited

## Refund Unwanted Trading Cards

If you no longer want one of a specific Trading Card Type,  or you want to turn a trading card into rewards, you can refund it for Bug Points or other rewards (this will only take one of this card, which makes the count go down by one, if it is already 1 remaining, it will remove it from your collection). Please note that this is different to erasing data.

### How To Refund Trading Cards

#### **Follow these steps to refund trading cards:**

On newer versions:

1. Go to the Collection tab (the SD card icon)
2. Select or search for the unwanted trading card or the trading card you want to refund.
3. Press Refund, and look at the list of rewards you will get, depending on its rarity.
4. Select Add To Refund List.
5. A 3 minute timer will start to countdown, which will merge together with other pending refund list cards if there is any, so if there is already 2 minutes left, the new timer will be 2 minutes. Make sure not to close Bugs+ during the timer, you can still refund more trading cards, or do other things. You can always cancel the timer and keep your trading cards by going to the Collection tab (the SD Card Icon) and click Cards To Be Refunded. You can then Cancel it, see what will be refunded and preview your rewards.
6. Near the end of the countdown, an 8 seconds siren countdown popup will show on the screen, saying that the cards will be refunded in a few seconds. You can cancel it, or claim the rewards on the popup. If there is no response, they will be claimed automatically.
