# Collection

When you collect Trading Cards from Daily Quests, the Bug Point Shop and more, you can find your Trading Cards in the Collection. You can find your Collection by pressing the SD card / trading card icon on the sidebar, which will take you to the Collection tab. You will also be able to see how many Trading cards you have there. There you can use the arrows to move between pages, and press the trading card to see it in bigger view, so you can see the insect facts on it. You can also ask AI about the card, if ”Explain With BugAI” is enabled in Settings. If you no longer want one of this card, you can refund it for Bug Points (this will only take one of this card, which makes the count go down by one, if it is already 1 remaining, it will remove it from your collection). You can also configure the Home tab (the house icon) to tell you how many trading cards you have even when you are not at the Collection tab by going to the Account Tab (the person icon), pressing Settings, pressing Homepage and selecting Show Trading Cards Count on Homepage.

Alongside finding it manually, you can also enter a exact trading card name in the box to jump straight to it, which includes the exact capitalisation.

You can also see the Trading Card’s rarity. This is how rare it is to get.

Possible rarities:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Ultra Rare
* Legendary
* Ultra Legendary
* Limited
