# Reset a forgotten PIN

You can reset your PIN if you do‘then know what it was. This will disable the PIN, but you can add it back after resetting it. You won’t loose your PIN requirements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your Bugs+ Application requires a PIN on every login on a new window, don’t use more than 11 attempts or else you will only be allowed to use a Recovery Code to recover. If you don’t have that, you would need to log out of Bugs+, so don’t use too many attempts.
{% endhint %}

Here are some options to reset it:

## Way 1: Recovery Code

If you have saved the recovery code and have access to it, you can reset your PIN easily. Here is how:

1. Open an area that requires the PIN, for example, the Disable PIN section in Settings.
2. Press Reset PIN, or I Forgot My PIN or something like that, whatever shows on the screen. This depends on your version, but all versions have a PIN reset function.
3. Press Use Recovery Code
4. Enter your recovery code
5. Press the OK button
6. Your PIN should be disabled it the recovery code was correct. If you want to re-enable your PIN, please follow the steps at [set.md](set.md "mention") support article.

{% hint style="info" %}
This only removes the PIN from this device. The recovery codes are different on every device and PIN use.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Recovery codes can only be used once, so make sure to save the new recovery code that you get when re-enabling your PIN.
{% endhint %}

## Way 2: Reset using a BugID

If you use a BugID, you can authenticate with the same BugID you use to access Bugs+. Here is how:

* Open an area that requires the PIN, for example, the Disable PIN section in Settings.
* Press Reset PIN, or I Forgot My PIN or something like that, whatever shows on the screen. This depends on your version, but all versions have a PIN reset function.
* Press Use BugID
* Login with your BugID. This also requires using your 2FA method.
* Press the button that appears on the screen after this.
* On Bugs+, press the I’ve Done That button. When you see PIN disabled, the PIN has been reset.
* If you want to re-enable your PIN, please follow the steps at [set.md](set.md "mention") support article.

{% hint style="info" %}
This only resets your PIN on the device you reset it on. Other devices requires signing in again on the other device using the recovery screen.
{% endhint %}

## Way 3: Log out of Bugs+

If all the other methods fails, you will need to Log Out of Bugs+. You can do this from the PIN recovery screen, or how you usually log out. In this tutorial we will be showing you how to do it from the Recovery screen.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you use Guest Mode, you will loose all your data when using this method. This is unrecoverable. Merging accounts requires PINs most of the time.

If you use BugID, this is fine unless you are locked out of your BugID and can’t recover it.
{% endhint %}



* Open an area that requires the PIN, for example, the Disable PIN section in Settings or the Bugs+ Lock Screen (if enabled).
* Press Reset PIN, or I Forgot My PIN or something like that, whatever shows on the screen. This depends on your version, but all versions have a PIN reset function.
* Press Can’t use these methods? or similar.
* Read the messages and warnings on the screen.
* Press Sign Out.
* Log back in to Bugs+, or re-enable Guest Mode.
* If you want to re-enable your PIN, please follow the steps at [set.md](set.md "mention") support article.
