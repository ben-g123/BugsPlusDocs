# Set a alternative PIN

Along with the PIN you already set, you can also have a second one that can also authenticate via the PIN screen. This is useful for sharing devices (mostly the child having a PIN and the parent having a PIN), and for other reasons as well.

Here is how to do this:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon).
2. Then, go press the Settings button.
3. Thirdly, Press More Settings.
4. After that, press Bugs+ Application PIN.
5. Press Set an Alternative PIN
6. Enter the primary PIN that is already enabled on your Bugs+ application.
7. Set your Alterntive PIN on the screen. This needs to be different to the Primary PIN code.
8. You now have a second PIN! Your primary pin will still work, but now Bugs+ can be unlocked with 2 PINs.

So, when you sign in again with the PIN, you can enter either your primary pin or your alternative pin. You just need to enter one, no need to enter both.
