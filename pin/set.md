# Set a PIN

In Bugs+, you can set a PIN so some features need a PIN to be used, which will protect your BugID and Bugs+ application if your device ever gets robbed. After you set a PIN, you can then configure requirements for when the PIN needs to be used. By default, it is required when disabling the PIN and when starting a trade, but more requirements can be added or removed later.

Here are some steps for setting a PIN code:

1. Go to the Account Tab (the person icon).
2. Then, go press the Settings button.
3. Thirdly, Press More Settings.
4. After that, press Bugs+ Application PIN.
5. Press Set PIN
6. Set your PIN on the screen. Make sure you type your PIN correctly since it won’t ask you to confirm.
7. You now have a PIN!

Some PINs can’t be used for security reasons, like 1234. If you get a pop up saying the PIN you entered was banned for future use, set another PIN since the PIN did not get saved since banned PINs can’t be used.

{% hint style="info" %}
The PINs are saved on your device, not the server. This means that if you use a BugID, the PIN you set is not synced on Bugs+ Sync, since you will need to change it per device if you want to. Also, signing out will remove the PIN and other game-related settings.
