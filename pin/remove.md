# Remove your PIN

If you no longer want to have a PIN in Bugs+, you can remove it. This will only work if you know your current PIN, so if you forgot it, please check out the [reset-a-forgotten-pin.md](reset-a-forgotten-pin.md "mention") support article from Bugs+. This won’t reset your PIN requirements, but your current PIN requirements won’t be enforced until you add the PIN again,

Follow the following steps to do this:

* Open the Account Tab (the person icon)
* Then, press Settings
* After that, press More Settings
* Foruthly, press Bugs+ Application PIN
* Select Disable PIN
* Enter your current PIN
* Press Disable PIN
* It’s done!

{% hint style="info" %}
This only resets your PIN on the device you did it on. If you no longer want to use a PIN on all your devices, please do it manually on your other devices as well.
{% endhint %}
