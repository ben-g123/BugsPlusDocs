## Part 3: Add A Child To Bugs+ - Parental Controls

You can also setup Parental Controls. Do this by creating an account for your child or teenager, or creating and merging a Guest Mode login and setting the age to the child or teenager's age, or if you already did this but chose the wrong age, contact Bugs+ Support for help. To make the most out of parental controls, you can use a second computer or device to manage parental controls and get more parental controls by doing that.
